The fund was to be financed by the state, and the government was authorized to issue bonds to raise the necessary funds. The bill also established a commission to oversee the implementation of the fund and to resolve any disputes that might arise."}

This resulted in a number of decompression sickness cases.\n[2]  The decompression tables are based on a number of assumptions, including the assumption that the diver is not overexerted during the dive. The tables are also based on the assumption that the diver will follow the recommended ascent procedure. In addition, the tables assume that the diver will be able to follow the recommended decompression procedure during the ascent.\n[3]  The decompression tables have been criticized for being too conservative, and for not taking into account the effects of O2 content on the decompression process. Some have argued that the tables should be more flexible, and that the ascent speeds should be adjusted according to the O2 content of the breathing gas.\n[4]  The ascent speeds indicated in the decompression tables are not necessarily the only way to avoid decompression sickness. In some cases, a slower ascent rate may be necessary in order to avoid decompression sickness. The choice of ascent rate depends on a number of factors, including the depth and duration of the dive, the O2 content of the breathing gas, and the diver\u2019s level of physical fitness.\n[5]  The decompression tables are not intended to be a substitute for proper training and experience.

In the present case, the Government submitted that the Lugansk SIZO was not under the control of the Ukrainian authorities and that the material conditions of the applicant\u2019s detention were not known to them.

However, the fact that the proposal was classified does not necessarily mean that it was unfounded or that the authorities were acting arbitrarily or in bad faith. The Court must therefore examine the substance of the proposal and assess whether the authorities' actions were reasonable and proportionate in the light of the information available to them at the time.\n\nIn this connection, the Court notes that the first applicant was subjected to surveillance on the basis of information that three persons of Arab origin were residing in Burgas. The Court is not aware of any evidence that these individuals were involved in any illegal activities, and it is therefore possible that the surveillance was based on a mistaken assumption.

The Armenian military has been occupying Azerbaijani territory since 1991, and has committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population, including the use of rape as a weapon of war.\n\nThe Armenian government and military must be held accountable for their actions, and the international community must continue to pressure them to respect the rights and dignity of the Azerbaijani people.

In the view of the Court, the Piraeus Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was based on a correct interpretation of the relevant provisions of Greek law, in particular the provisions of the Civil Code and the Town Planning Law. The Court noted that the Civil Code provides that land which has been freely used by local people for a continuous period of 30 years becomes public land, and that the Town Planning Law provides that land which is not included in the official planning charts of a municipality is not considered to be part of that municipality\u2019s property. The Court also noted that the Piraeus Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was in line with the principles of public law and the protection of the rights of local communities, as it allowed the municipality of Spetses to use the disputed land for the benefit of the local community.\n17.  The Court further observed that the applicants\u2019 arguments that the disputed land was included in their title deeds and that they had been the only users of the land for many years were not convincing. It considered that the fact that the land appeared in the title deeds of the applicants did not necessarily mean that it was their private property, as the title deeds did not provide any information on the use of the land. The Court also noted that the applicants\u2019 arguments regarding their use of the land were not supported by any evidence.\n18.

The field, located in the North Sea, had an estimated reserves of 2.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The Ekofisk field was developed through a joint venture between the Norwegian state-owned company Statoil (now Equinor) and the British company BP.

However, it is worth noting that the 2004 census did not distinguish between Moldovan and Romanian nationality, and it is likely that many Moldovans holding a second nationality other than Romanian also hold a Moldovan passport.\n29.  The number of Moldovans holding a second nationality other than Romanian is likely to have increased since the 2004 census, due to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and the resulting displacement of people. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of 31 December 2015 there were approximately 25,000 Moldovan refugees in Ukraine, many of whom are likely to hold a second nationality other than Romanian.\n30.  The number of Moldovans holding a second nationality other than Romanian is also likely to have increased due to the relaxation of Moldova's citizenship laws in 2013. Prior to 2013, Moldovan citizenship was only granted to those who had a parent or grandparent who was a Moldovan citizen. However, in 2013 the law was amended to allow for the granting of citizenship to those who have a \"close connection\" to Moldova, including those who have lived in the country for at least 10 years. This has led to a significant increase in the number of foreigners applying for Moldovan citizenship.\n31.  According to the Moldovan Ministry of Justice, in 2015 alone, 1,174 foreigners were granted Moldovan citizenship, including 200 Ukrainians and 100 Russians. While these figures do not provide a complete picture of the number of Moldovans holding a second nationality other than Romanian, they do suggest that the number is likely to be significant.\n32.

In September 2009 the ECtHR accepted the VCA's complaint and declared it admissible. The Court's decision was based on the finding that there had been a violation of the VCA's right to property, as the company had been deprived of its property without adequate compensation. The Court noted that the Russian authorities had failed to provide the VCA with an effective remedy for the violation of its rights.\n\n65.

The Transnistrian authorities defended their actions on the grounds that the Dniester River constituted a \u201cstate border\u201d and that Vadim Pisari had therefore committed an offence under the Transnistrian Criminal Code by crossing it without permission.

Or will he be tempted to make use of his impending departure to indulge in a bit of unseemly behaviour? The latter scenario is of course purely speculative, but it is one that is being discussed in the highest circles.\nAs for the Klestils themselves, they are of course remaining tight-lipped about the whole affair. They have issued a statement denying the rumours and expressing their gratitude for the support they have received during their time in office.

In 1967, the Government of Malta issued a decree which purported to expropriate Tenement 277 and to transfer it to the applicants and/or their ancestors as the owners of the land. The decree was issued on the basis of a law which provided for the expropriation of land for public purposes. The applicants and/or their ancestors did not receive any compensation for the expropriation of their land.\n9.  The applicants and/or their ancestors challenged the decree in the Maltese courts, but their claims were rejected.

However, the courts held that the decree was lawful and that the expropriation was necessary for public purposes.\n10.

(b)  The programme then goes on to challenge this picture of Switzerland as a heroic resistance fighter. It presents the Swiss authorities as having collaborated with the Nazis, and the Swiss people as having been passive in the face of this collaboration. The programme refers to the fact that Switzerland had a \u2018protective wall\u2019, that is to say a border with Germany, and that it was thus able to protect itself from the war. It also refers to the fact that the Swiss authorities had made agreements with the Nazis, such as the so-called \u2018Racial Agreement\u2019.  (c)  The programme then goes on to examine the situation after the war, when the Swiss authorities and the Swiss people were confronted with the fact that they had collaborated with the Nazis.

It refers to the fact that the Swiss authorities are still trying to cover up the facts, and that the Swiss people are still trying to justify their actions. 7.

The programme is based on a series of assertions, some of which are not supported by the evidence. For example, the programme asserts that the Swiss authorities collaborated with the Nazis, without presenting any evidence to support this assertion. Similarly, the programme asserts that the Swiss people were passive in the face of this collaboration, without presenting any evidence to support this assertion. 9.

Hizb ut-Tahrir is a political party that seeks to establish a global Islamic state based on its interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir was formed in 1953 in Jerusalem by a group of Islamic scholars and activists who were dissatisfied with the political and social conditions in the Arab world. The party\u2019s main objective is to create a unified Islamic state that will be governed by Islamic law (shariah) and will include all Muslim-majority countries.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir\u2019s ideology is based on the belief that Islam is a complete and comprehensive way of life, and that it is the only political and social system that can bring about true justice and equality in the world. The party\u2019s leaders and members believe that the current political and social systems in Muslim-majority countries are corrupt and oppressive, and that they must be replaced by a system based on Islamic law.\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir\u2019s strategy for achieving its goals is to work through peaceful means, such as education, propaganda, and political activism. The party\u2019s members and supporters are encouraged to engage in da\u2019wa (proselytising) and to spread the party\u2019s message to Muslims around the world. Hizb ut-Tahrir also encourages its members to participate in political and social activities, such as organising protests and demonstrations, and to work with other Islamic organisations to achieve common goals.\n\nDespite its peaceful nature, Hizb ut-Tahrir has been accused of being a terrorist organisation by some governments and media outlets. However, the party has consistently denied these accusations and has stated that it is committed to peaceful and democratic means of achieving its goals.\n\nIn conclusion, Hizb ut-Tahrir is a political party that seeks to establish a global Islamic state based on its interpretation of Islamic law.

The statement did not contain any information about the evidence presented at the hearing or the conclusions drawn from it.\n\nThe decision to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir in Russia was based on the fact that the organisation pursues the goal of establishing a worldwide Islamic caliphate by force, and that it uses terrorist methods to achieve this goal. However, the ban has been criticised by human rights organisations, who argue that it is unjustified and violates the right to freedom of religion and belief.\n\nIn conclusion, the ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir in Russia is a complex and controversial issue, with different perspectives on the legality and legitimacy of the decision. While the Russian authorities have argued that the organisation is a terrorist group and poses a threat to national security, human rights organisations have criticised the ban as unjustified and violating the right to freedom of religion and belief. Ultimately, the issue is a matter of interpretation and debate, and it is important to consider the perspectives of all parties involved."}

In the present case, the Court finds that the applicant was not afforded the right to a public trial. The meetings between the applicant's lawyers and the security forces were held in secret, without any public presence. The Court also notes that the applicant was not represented by a lawyer during these meetings.\n\n36.  As regards the applicant's allegation that he was not represented by a lawyer during the hearing, the Court notes that the applicant was represented by a lawyer at the hearing, but that the lawyer was not present during the meetings between the applicant's lawyers and the security forces.\n\n37.  Having regard to the foregoing, the Court concludes that the applicant's right to a fair trial, as enshrined in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, was violated in the present case.\n\nIII.

The Russian troops were authorized to remain in Transdniestria until the situation in the region stabilized and the Moldovan government had regained control over the territory. The decree was seen as a sign of Russian determination to maintain its influence in the region, and was widely interpreted as a violation of Moldova\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nIn June 1992 the ROG launched a series of offensives against the Moldovan forces, driving them out of some villages from the left bank of the Dniester river, and on 11 June the separatists declared the independence of Transdniestria. On 25 June 1992 the Moldovan parliament adopted a resolution calling for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Transdniestria, and on 2 July 1992 the President of the Russian Federation, Mr Boris Yeltsin, announced that the ROG would be disbanded and the Russian troops would be withdrawn from Transdniestria by the end of July. However, the withdrawal of the Russian troops did not begin until September 1992, and the ROG continued to operate in Transdniestria until 1994.\n\nThe conflict in Transdniestria was characterized by a series of violent clashes between the Moldovan and separatist forces, and the use of force by the Russian military to maintain control over the region. The conflict also had significant repercussions for the political and economic stability of Moldova, and the relationship between Moldova and Russia.\n\nIn conclusion, the conflict in Transdniestria was a result of the complex interplay of political, economic and historical factors, which led to the secession of the region from Moldova and the subsequent conflict between the Moldovan and separatist forces.

The Government stated that the applicant had not been able to provide any evidence to support his allegations and that the investigations conducted by the authorities had not found any evidence of the applicant\u2019s involvement in the disappearances.\n\nIn the first place, the Government's statement that the newspaper article submitted by the applicant had no connection with the applicant's case is incorrect. The article was published in the Urus-Martan newspaper on 27 February 2002 and reported the discovery of several corpses in the Urus-Martan district. The article stated that the bodies had been found in the orchards on the outskirts of Urus-Martan and that the authorities had been unable to identify the bodies.

The Court held that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Act and the Criminal Procedure Act were unconstitutional and that the legislature should adopt new provisions that would ensure the protection of the rights of the applicants.\n13.
