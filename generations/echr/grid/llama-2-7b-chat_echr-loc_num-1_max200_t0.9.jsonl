The applicants complained that the trial court's failure to assess their risk of removal to Azerbaijan violated their right to a fair trial and the prohibition of discrimination under Article 7 of the Convention. They also claimed that the Supreme Court's decision not to address this issue amounted to a breach of the same provision.\n\n29.  The Court finds that the applicants' complaint is well-founded. The trial court's failure to assess their risk of removal to Azerbaijan was a significant factor in the applicants' conviction and sentence, as it meant that they were not able to demonstrate that they were at risk of persecution or other serious harm in Azerbaijan. This failure was a breach of the applicants' right to a fair trial and the prohibition of discrimination under Article 7 of the Convention.\n\n30.  The Court further finds that the Supreme Court's decision not to address this issue was also a breach of the applicants' rights under Article 7.

{"idx": 86, "label": "the North Sea", "output": "1988, the US Navy Diving Manual recommended 12-15 minutes as the maximum time for decompression in open circuit heliox, and the European offshore diving standard recommended 10-15 minutes as the maximum time for decompression in open circuit air or heliox. The US Navy Diving Manual also recommended that the maximum ascent time for decompression in open circuit heliox should not exceed 10 minutes. In the case of saturation diving, the time for decompression is not fixed, but is dependent on the rate of ascent. The decompression tables are the basis for these recommendations. The time factor is important, since the diver is not able to take in enough gas to breathe during the decompression, and must therefore breathe gas at a lower pressure than normal. The tables are calculated on the basis of a standard pressure of 1 atmosphere (1013 mbar) and a standard temperature of 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F). In the case of saturation diving, the decompression tables are not valid for times of decompression greater than 12 hours. This is because the gas in the body has a limited capacity for storage, and the body can only hold a certain amount of gas in this form. In the case of decompression for longer than 12 hours, the body will release the gas in the form of bubbles, which can lead to the formation of gas bubbles in the blood and other tissues. The decompression tables are also not valid for times of decompression greater than 24 hours. This is because the body can only handle a certain amount of gas in this form over a certain period of time. In the case of decompression for longer than 24 hours, the body will release the gas in the form of bubbles, which can lead to the formation of gas bubbles in the blood and other tissues. The decompression tables are not valid for depths greater than 300 m (1000 ft). This is because the pressure at depths greater than 300 m is too high for the tables to be accurate. In the case of diving to depths greater than 300 m, the decompression tables must be modified in order to take into account the increased pressure. The tables are not valid for times of decompression greater than 4"}

It argued that the term \"person\" in section 116 should be interpreted broadly, and that it was not limited to natural persons.\n\n13.  The German Government submitted that the term \"person\" in section 116 of the German Code of Civil Procedure referred to natural persons, and that legal persons, including companies, were not entitled to legal aid. They argued that the term \"person\" in the German Civil Code, which was the source of section 116, referred only to natural persons, and that this wording had been retained in the Code of Civil Procedure without change.\n\n14.  The Court notes that the applicant company is a German company with its registered office in Germany, and is therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the German courts.

On 31 October they were given a copy of the log book, which contained the following entries:\n(a) the applicants had been detained by the FSB on 19 October;\n(b) they had been taken to the FSB\u2019s premises for questioning;\n(c) they had been released on 21 October;\n(d) the FSB had taken the applicants\u2019 personal belongings, including their passports and mobile phones, and had destroyed their vehicle.\n45. The applicants submitted that the log book entries were inconsistent with the FSB\u2019s version of events and amounted to a cover-up. They argued that the FSB had intentionally destroyed the log book in order to prevent them from obtaining a copy and to avoid accountability for their actions.\n46.

The acquittal was based on the finding that the uncontrolled sand draining from \u00c7olak\u2019s car was the cause of the incident.\n\n10.  Following the acquittal, the first applicant brought an action for damages against the State, alleging that the uncontrolled sand draining from \u00c7olak\u2019s car was a result of the State\u2019s failure to properly maintain the road and that this failure had caused A.O.\u2019s death. The first applicant claimed that the State had a duty of care to ensure that the road was maintained in a safe condition, and that the State\u2019s failure to do so had caused A.O.\u2019s death.\n\n11.  The State contested the first applicant\u2019s claim, arguing that the incident was caused by the uncontrolled sand draining from \u00c7olak\u2019s car and that the State could not be held responsible for the actions of the driver of the car. The State also argued that the first applicant had failed to establish any causal link between the State\u2019s failure to maintain the road and A.O.\u2019s death.\n\n12.  The court found that the State had a duty of care to ensure that the road was maintained in a safe condition and that the State\u2019s failure to do so had caused A.O.\u2019s death.

In the present case, the applicants argue that the Skopje Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that there was a risk of their absconding is not based on any evidence and is therefore unreasonable. They submit that they have a strong connection to the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, including a permanent residence and family ties, and that they are unlikely to abscond.\n25.  The Court considers that the issue of the risk of absconding is a complex one that must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances of the case. While the Skopje Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that there was a risk of the applicants absconding may be open to challenge, it is not arbitrary or unreasonable in the present circumstances.\n26.  In the present case, the applicants have provided no evidence of their connections to the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, other than their claim to have a permanent residence and family ties. The Skopje Court of Appeal was therefore entitled to conclude that these connections were insufficient to overcome the risk of absconding.\n27.  Furthermore, the Court notes that the applicants were convicted of serious criminal offences, including the murder of a police officer, and that they faced a sentence of imprisonment. In these circumstances, it is understandable that the Skopje Court of Appeal considered it necessary to impose bail conditions to ensure the safety of the community and to prevent the applicants from absconding.\n28.

The officer went up to him and asked him to come to the office for a conversation. The man agreed. The officer took the man to the office and asked him to sit down. The officer then asked the man to state his name and to provide his identity documents. The man gave his name and showed the officer his identity documents. The officer then arrested the man on suspicion of involvement in the commission of a crime, as he had been identified by an eyewitness. The officer did not use any force during the arrest. The man was taken to the Grozny police station, where he was placed in a cell and held for about two days before being transferred to the Chechen Republic Investigation Committee.\u201d\n93.  The Court notes that the officer\u2019s account does not mention that the applicant was arrested in the presence of other police officers or that any other police officers were involved in the arrest. The officer\u2019s account also does not provide any details about the eyewitness who identified the applicant or the circumstances of the crime for which the applicant was arrested. The Court considers that the account provided by the officer is not sufficient to establish the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s arrest and does not provide any concrete evidence to support the applicant\u2019s claim that he was arrested without any justification.\n94.  The Court further notes that the applicant has not provided any evidence to support his claim that he was arrested in the presence of other police officers or that any other police officers were involved in the arrest. The Court considers that the absence of any such evidence does not necessarily undermine the applicant\u2019s claim, as the police officer\u2019s account does not provide any details about the circumstances of the arrest. However, the Court considers that the lack of any corroborating evidence from other police officers or witnesses is a factor that weighs against the applicant\u2019s claim.\n95.  In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that he was arrested in the presence of other police officers or that any other police officers were involved in the arrest.

Firstly, the Court noted that the applicants had been charged with the offence of being a subsidiary person of an illegal organisation, which was a criminal offence under Turkish law. The Court was not, however, required to consider whether the PKK was an illegal organisation under Turkish law. It was sufficient for the Court to determine whether the applicants had been shown to be subsidiary persons of that organisation.\n\nThe Court held that the evidence in the case of \u0130mam \u015eahin had been sufficient to establish that he had been a subsidiary person of the PKK.

The fact that the applicants were arrested and detained for several days suggests that they were not treated with excessive force.\n\n56.

The Court notes that the applicant's claim that the cordon was extremely tight and multi-layered, and that visibility from outside the cordon to inside was practically non-existent, is supported by the evidence provided by the authorities. The photographs taken by the police officers and provided by the authorities show that the cordon was indeed extremely tight and multi-layered, and that visibility from outside the cordon to inside was limited.\n\n25.  The Court also notes that the applicant's claim that he was not allowed to leave the cordoned area is supported by the evidence provided by the authorities.

It also underscores the importance of ensuring that former public officials do not use their position to profit personally from decisions they made while in office.\n17.  The case of Schr\u00f6der\u2019s involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project serves as a reminder of the need for robust ethics rules and regulations to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that public officials act in the public interest.\n18.  In order to prevent such conflicts of interest, it is essential that public officials disclose any potential conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from decision-making processes where necessary.\n19.  Furthermore, it is crucial that public officials are subject to regular ethics checks and that there are mechanisms in place to investigate and punish any violations of ethics rules.\n20.  By implementing these measures, governments can help to ensure that public officials act in the public interest and that the public trust in government is maintained.\n\nThe passage presents a case study of a controversial situation involving a former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and his involvement in a gas pipeline project. The passage highlights the potential for conflict of interest and the need for transparency and ethical rules to prevent such conflicts. The case also underscores the importance"}

However, the Court also found that it was not possible to determine whether the diving company had complied with the requirements of the relevant regulations, or whether the diving operation was carried out with the necessary safety measures.\n\nThe High Court\u2019s conclusion is not surprising given the lack of evidence of a safety system in place at the time of the accident to ensure that the diving company had adequate medical follow-up procedures in place. In addition, the lack of evidence of adequate training for Mr Vilnes also suggests that the diving company may not have taken the necessary steps to ensure that the diving operation was carried out with the necessary safety measures."}

They believed that the Moldovan government had no right to exercise authority over the region, which they considered to be a part of Russia.\n\n(b) Vadim Pisari's actions had several consequences: he and his friend were taken into custody and interrogated by the Transnistrian border guards, and they were forced to sign a statement acknowledging that they had illegally crossed the border and were guilty of \"unauthorized entry into the Transnistrian Republic\". They were also released and returned to the left bank of the Dniester River, but they may have faced further punishment or prosecution under Transnistrian law. Additionally, Vadim Pisari's actions may have been seen as a violation of the Transnistrian authorities' sovereignty and territorial integrity, and could have led to further tensions between the two sides."}

While the investigator\u2019s questions to witness S. M. and A.

In particular, the Government has not provided any documents or other evidence that would confirm Mr Khanpasha Dzhabrailov's death.

Similarly, there is no evidence to dispute the applicant\u2019s claims about the restrictions on his ability to make telephone calls.\n\n42. As regards the allegations about the number of visitors allowed to see the applicant during family visits, the Court notes that the Government has provided some evidence to support its contention that the applicant\u2019s family members were allowed to visit him in reasonable numbers.

The pact allowed the USSR to annex the Baltic States without facing any resistance from Germany, as the pact had secretly agreed to divide Eastern Europe between the two powers.\n13.  The Soviet Union\u2019s annexation of the Baltic States in 1940 was a violation of international law and the sovereignty of the affected countries. The annexation was also a result of the USSR\u2019s aggressive policy towards its neighbors, which was facilitated by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n14.  The annexation of the Baltic States by the USSR in 1940 was a significant event in the history of Eastern Europe, as it marked the beginning of the Soviet Union\u2019s control over the region. The annexation also had far-reaching consequences for the countries of the region, as it led to the suppression of their independence and the imposition of Soviet rule.\n15.  The Soviet Union\u2019s annexation of the Baltic States in 1940 was a major factor in the outbreak of World War II. The invasion of Poland by Germany in 1939, which was followed by the Soviet Union\u2019s annexation of the Baltic States, led to the start of the war.

The applicants are currently in detention in the United States pending trial.\n\nIn the present case, the Court is being asked to rule on whether the material support alleged in the indictments falls within the scope of the term \"crime against peace\" within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention.\n\nIn its application, the United States Government has argued that the offences charged in the indictments are criminal in nature, and are therefore within the scope of the term \"crime against peace\" as defined in Article 1 of the Convention. In the alternative, the Government has argued that even if the offences are not \"crimes against peace\" in the strict sense, they are nevertheless \"crimes against the peace\" within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention.\n\nThe Court notes that the term \"crime against peace\" is not defined in the Convention, and that there is no consensus among the States parties as to its meaning. In the absence of a clear definition, the Court is called upon to make an assessment of the meaning of the term \"crime against peace\" in the light of the general principles of international law.\n\nThe Court observes that the term \"crime against peace\" is used in the Convention in a broad sense, encompassing any act which is intended to disrupt the peace or stability of a country or to bring about a situation of generalised violence or instability. In this sense, the term \"crime against peace\" includes not only acts of aggression, but also any other act which, by its nature or by its effects, is capable of threatening the peace and security of a country.\n\nThe Court further observes that the offences charged in the indictments are not only criminal in nature, but also have the potential to disrupt the peace and stability of the countries in which they were committed. The provision of material support to terrorists, whether through the Internet or otherwise, can contribute to the perpetuation of terrorism and violence, and can undermine the stability and security of a country.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the Court concludes that the offences charged in the indict"}

At the same time, the local authorities were unable to offer the investors the necessary support and guarantees, which is why they were forced to look for partners among the criminal structures. The investigation also revealed that the criminal structures involved in the Kolymaenergo case were connected with the authorities and the law-enforcement agencies. The investigation uncovered the fact that the criminal structures were engaged in illegal activities such as extortion, embezzlement, money laundering, fraud and the like.\nAt the end of 2001, Investory Kolymy submitted a petition to the Prosecutor's Office of the Magadan Region, in which it demanded that the criminal case be brought against the persons who had committed the crimes. In 2002, the Prosecutor's Office of the Magadan Region initiated a criminal case against the persons who had committed the crimes.\nIn 2003, the Magadan Town Court passed a decision on the case. The Court found that the actions of the defendants constituted a crime and sentenced them to imprisonment terms ranging from 5 to 12 years. The court also ordered the defendants to pay a fine of 200,000 roubles each.\nThe case of Kolymaenergo was unique in the sense that it involved a large-scale crime and the abuse of power by the authorities.

According to the World Health Organization, 87% of Sudanese women who have undergone FGM experience genital bleeding, 60% have urinary problems, 50% have vaginal infections, 25% have infertility, and 10% have complications during childbirth. The prevalence of FGM is higher among women who have undergone the more severe forms of FGM. In the 1990s, the Sudanese government introduced a new national health policy which aimed to promote the health of women and girls by abandoning the practice of FGM. The policy was successful in reducing the number of women who had undergone FGM from 93% in 1990 to 76% in 2005.\n\nThe Sudanese government has also introduced a national plan to eliminate FGM by 2020. This plan aims to raise awareness among the population and to strengthen the legal framework. The Sudanese government also established a national committee to monitor the implementation of the plan. The committee has published a report on the progress made in 2016. According to the report, the number of circumcised women has decreased from 89% in 2013 to 76% in 2016.\n\nIn conclusion, FGM is a serious human rights violation and a major obstacle to the health and well-being of women and girls in Sudan.

In June, the UN Committee against Torture also expressed concern about the lack of progress in addressing torture and other ill-treatment in Kazakhstan.\nIn October, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed a decree establishing a National Preventive Mechanism to monitor and investigate the use of torture and other ill-treatment in places of detention. The decree came into force in December.\nHowever, despite these efforts, torture and other ill-treatment continued to be reported in Kazakhstan, including in police stations, detention centers and other places of detention. There were also reports of beatings, including of detainees and suspects in police custody.\nThe lack of independence of the judiciary and the lack of effective investigation and prosecution of torture and other ill-treatment cases remained a major problem.\nIn 2011, Amnesty International documented several cases of torture and other ill-treatment in Kazakhstan, including the case of a 19-year-old man who was beaten and tortured by police officers in the city of Almaty in January. The man was arrested for attempting to sell drugs and was beaten and tortured for several hours before being taken to a police station.

The Court of Appeal also found that the building permit had been issued in the exercise of the powers conferred by law, and that the building works had been carried out in compliance with the building regulations.\n22.  The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in a judgment of 16 November 2001, upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the building works were not carried out in compliance with the building regulations. The Court also held that the building permit had been issued in the exercise of the powers conferred by law, and that there had been no breach of the right to property.\n23.  In the present case, the plaintiff alleges that the building works were carried out without the necessary planning permission, and that the building permit was issued in violation of the right to property. The plaintiff claims that the defendant's actions constituted a breach of the right to property, and that the building works are therefore invalid.\n24.  The defendant, on the other hand, argues that the building works were carried out in compliance with the relevant legislation, and that the plaintiff's claims are unfounded. The defendant also argues that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the building works were carried out without the necessary planning permission, and that the building permit was issued in violation of the right to property.\n25.  The issue in this case is whether the building works were carried out in compliance with the relevant legislation, and whether the defendant's actions constituted a breach of the right to property.

However, this was denied by Movsar Tagirov, who stated that he had not been arrested or detained in the Chechen Republic and that he had not been suspected of any illegal activity.\n\nThe case of Movsar Tagirov was one of several in which individuals were accused of involvement in the 1999 apartment bombings in Moscow.

The lack of coordination and cooperation between law enforcement agencies, as well as the politicization of the legal system, can lead to inconsistencies and contradictions in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes."}

The fact that the High Court has jurisdiction to consider this issue does not make the claim unsustainable, but rather highlights the fact that the appellants' position is not as straightforward as they may have argued.\nThe issue of incompatibility arises in this case as the 1998 Act does not provide for the High Court to have jurisdiction to consider an application to strike out a claim in respect of a claim that is incompatible with EU law. It is not a matter that can be considered by the county court, which has limited jurisdiction to consider questions of EU law. The fact that the High Court has jurisdiction to consider the issue does not mean that it is not an issue that should be considered, but rather that it is an issue that is capable of being considered in the High Court.\nIn the light of the above, I consider that the claim should be struck out on the basis that it is unsustainable, as it is incompatible with EU law.\nI would like to add that the above is the decision of the judge and it is not binding on any other court.

The assessment of risk was not only a matter of categorising the refugee's ethnic or political identity, but also of evaluating the individual's level of involvement in the political and social life of Zaire and the degree to which they had contributed to the country's instability.\n\nThe assessment of risk was not only based on the refugee's own actions and affiliations, but also on their perceived level of threat to the stability of Zaire. In other words, the assessment of risk was not just a matter of categorising the refugee's ethnic or political identity, but also of evaluating the individual's level of involvement in the political and social life of Zaire and the degree to which they had contributed to the country's instability.\n\nIn addition to the above categories, the assessment of risk was also influenced by the refugee's country of origin. Refugees from certain countries were considered to be more at risk than others. This was based on the assumption that those from countries with a history of political instability or conflict were more likely to pose a security threat to Zaire.\n\nIt is important to note that the assessment of risk was not always based on objective criteria, but was often influenced by the political and ideological views of the assessors. This was particularly true in the case of high-ranking officers of the FAZ and members of the garde civile, whose risk assessment was often influenced by their political affiliations and the perceived level of threat they posed to the stability of the Mobutu regime.\n\nOverall, the assessment of risk was a complex and subjective process that was influenced by a variety of factors, including the refugee's ethnic or political identity, their level of involvement in the political and social life of Zaire, and their perceived level of threat to the stability of the country."}

The court further ordered the applicants to pay damages to the State for the use of the land during the period of their unauthorized possession.\n\n22.  The applicants appealed against the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case as the disputed land was a forest reserve and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. The High Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the trial court's judgment.\n\n23.  The applicants then brought a petition for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by a majority decision. The Supreme Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the case and that the applicants had unlawfully entered into possession of the State forest land.\n\n24.

In the present case, the Court notes that the applicant has not demonstrated that the child would be better off returning to Romania, where he would be deprived of his father\u2019s care and custody. In contrast, the court found that the child had been integrated into Italian society and that his return to Romania would cause him significant psychological harm.

The Court acknowledges that the club provides a social and cultural asset for the local community, but it also acknowledges that the noise and disruption caused by it have been a source of concern for the neighbours.\n18.  In light of the above considerations, the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention in this case."}

In the years following the events of 4 October 2006, the applicant experienced a range of difficulties in his employment and personal life. He was subject to repeated harassment and threats by the police and other authorities, and was forced to change his place of work several times in order to avoid detection. The applicant was also denied entry to the Russian Federation on several occasions, and was subject to other forms of harassment and intimidation.\n\n13. The applicant's case was eventually referred to the European Court of Human Rights (the \"Court\") by the Russian Government in 2012. In a judgment delivered on 13 June 2014, the Court found that the applicant's arrest and detention had been unlawful, and that the authorities had failed to carry out a proper investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment. The Court also found that the applicant's rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the \"Convention\") had been violated, and that the Russian Federation was responsible for the violation. The Court awarded the applicant damages and declared that the Russian Federation was to pay the costs of the application.\n\n14. The Russian Government have appealed against the Court's judgment, and the case is currently pending before the Grand Chamber of the Court. In the meantime, the applicant has received a significant amount of damages and costs, which he has been unable to use due to the ongoing legal proceedings.\n\n15. The applicant's case is not an isolated incident. There have been numerous reports of Georgian nationals being subject to harassment, threats and violence in the Russian Federation, particularly in the context of employment. The applicant's case is emblematic of the difficulties that many Georgian nationals face in the Russian Federation, including the lack of protection for their rights and the failure of the authorities to investigate allegations of ill-treatment.\n\n16."}

The delegation was informed that the number of prisoners in the region has been steadily increasing over recent years, largely as a result of the increased use of imprisonment for non-criminal offences. In the past, imprisonment was generally reserved for serious crimes, but now it is also being used for minor offences such as non-payment of fines and failure to comply with certain administrative measures. 44.  In the view of the delegation, the situation described above is of a particularly serious nature, as it leads to the degradation of the human dignity of the prisoners and of the prison staff, and undermines the rehabilitation of prisoners. The delegation therefore urges the authorities to take immediate steps to reduce the number of prisoners and to improve the conditions of imprisonment in order to ensure that the fundamental rights of prisoners are respected."}

In relation to the marine risks, the judge noted that:\n\u201c... it is common ground that, if an escape of LNG were to occur, there is a risk of the formation of a flammable gas cloud. The risk is said to arise from the fact that the LNG is contained in a tank surrounded by air. The air is warmed by the tank and, as the gas is released, it is ignited by the warm air.
