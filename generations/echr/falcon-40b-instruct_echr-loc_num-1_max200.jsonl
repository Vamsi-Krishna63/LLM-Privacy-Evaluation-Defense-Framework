This detail is intended to show that the crime was committed in a public place, in front of witnesses who approved of it. The allegation is therefore defamatory, and the author should have taken care to ensure that it was not false.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the allegation was not defamatory because it was not made in a sufficiently precise manner. It considered that the words \u2018in the presence of several hundred people\u2019 did not mean that the crime was committed in a public place, but only that the witnesses were present at the scene of the crime.\nThe Supreme Court has rejected this interpretation. It held that the words \u2018in the presence of several hundred people\u2019 do not merely mean that the witnesses were present at the scene of the crime, but that they were present in a public place and that they were watching the crime being committed. It added that the author should have taken care to ensure that the allegation was not false, because it was not a question of a literary fiction but of a real event, and because the allegation was likely to be taken seriously by the reader.\nThe Supreme Court held that the author had committed a fault, and that the allegation was defamatory. It ordered him to pay \u20ac1 in damages to Jean-Marie Le Pen.\nComment\nThis decision is remarkable for several reasons. Firstly, it is unusual for a politician to sue for defamation in respect of a work of fiction. Secondly, the Supreme Court has confirmed that the allegation was defamatory, even though it was not made in a sufficiently precise manner.

Additionally, the diver may put themselves and others in danger by diving in an unsafe or compromised state, increasing the risk of accidents or other complications."}

In addition, the Court notes that the applicants have not provided any information on the existence of a Moldovan minority in other countries.\n31.  In the light of the above, the Court finds that the applicants have not demonstrated that they belong to a \u201cpeople\u201d within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n32.

Forensic analysis confirmed that all of the body parts belonged to the same individual.\n\nThe body parts were found in different locations in the loch, some of them up to 6 miles apart. The police investigation was led by Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Campbell. He said: \"It is clear that the body has been in the water for some time and that it has been subject to considerable decomposition.\"\n\nThe police believed that the body parts were from a single individual, and they estimated that the person had been dead for between 6 months and 2 years. They also believed that the body parts had been deliberately placed in the loch.\n\nThe police released a description of the victim:\n\n- The victim was a white male, aged between 25 and 40 years old.\n- He was 5 feet 6 inches tall and of medium build.\n- He had short brown hair and a beard.\n- He had a tattoo of a dragon on his right upper arm.\n- He was wearing a green fleece jacket, a red T-shirt, blue jeans and white trainers.\n\nThe police appealed for information from the public, and they received more than 100 calls. However, none of the leads led to a positive identification of the victim.\n\nThe police released a computer-generated image of the victim, which was based on a reconstruction of his skull. The image was widely circulated in the media, but it did not lead to any positive identifications.\n\nIn January 2000 the police announced that they were scaling down the investigation, but they would continue to investigate any new information that was received.\n\nThe case remains unsolved, and the identity of the victim is still unknown."}

On 4 June 2002 the investigator informed the applicant\u2019s husband that the investigation had been discontinued. 240. The applicant\u2019s husband also stated that in May 2002 he had spoken with the local journalist Mr R.T. who had told him that the investigation had been suspended in respect of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev and that the investigator had been dismissed. The journalist had also told him that Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev had been arrested by the Russian military. 241. The Government did not provide any information about the reasons for the discontinuation of the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev. They also did not provide any information about the whereabouts of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev. 242. The Court notes that the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev was discontinued in May 2002. The Government did not provide any information about the reasons for the discontinuation of the investigation. The Court cannot exclude that the investigation was discontinued for reasons other than the absence of any evidence. The Court therefore considers that the investigation into the disappearance of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev was not effective. 243. The Court further notes that the Government did not provide any information about the whereabouts of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev. 244. The Court considers that the Government have failed to comply with their positive obligation to conduct an effective investigation into the disappearance of Mr Ziyavdi Elmurzayev. 245.

The applicant complained that the domestic authorities had failed to investigate the abduction of his brother and to punish the perpetrators. He relied on Articles 2, 3, 5, 13 and 14 of the Convention.\n\n138. The Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s complaint was inadmissible. They argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, as he had not pursued the criminal proceedings against his brother\u2019s abductors. They also submitted that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that the authorities had been involved in the abduction.\n\n139. The Court notes that the applicant complained that the authorities had failed to investigate the abduction of his brother and to punish the perpetrators. The Court considers that the applicant has exhausted domestic remedies in respect of this complaint. It is true that the applicant did not pursue the criminal proceedings against his brother\u2019s abductors, but the Court considers that this was because the authorities had refused to open a criminal investigation into the abduction. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s failure to pursue the criminal proceedings did not prevent him from exhausting domestic remedies in respect of his complaint that the authorities had failed to investigate the abduction.\n\n140. The Court further notes that the Government did not submit any evidence to show that the authorities had not been involved in the abduction. On the contrary, the Government submitted that the applicant\u2019s brother had been abducted by law-enforcement officers.\n\n141. The Court therefore concludes that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of the applicant\u2019s complaint that the authorities had failed to investigate the abduction of his brother and to punish the perpetrators.\n\nIII.

In the course of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal the C. company had submitted that the film footage was not protected by the right to freedom of expression because it was obtained by means of an infringement of its property rights and of the secrecy of its research laboratory.

The applicants also claim that the prison administration had failed to take any preventive measures to protect them from the threat of violence, despite their repeated requests for transfer to a safer prison. The Government denied that the applicants had informed the prison administration of their fear of reprisals.\n\n30.  The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 fear of reprisals was based on the fact that they had been threatened by other detainees and that they had previously been subjected to ill-treatment. The Court considers that the applicants\u2019 fear was well-founded and that the authorities had an obligation to take measures to protect them from the threat of violence.\n\n31.  The Court notes that the applicants were transferred to prison no. 29/4, which was considered to be a safer prison.

In 1992 the Transnistrian region became the subject of a conflict between the Moldovan authorities and the separatist forces. The conflict ended in 1992 with a ceasefire agreement, but it was not resolved.

The Moldovan authorities, on the other hand, have limited control over the region.\n\nThe conflict has had serious consequences for the human rights situation in the region. The separatist authorities have been accused of serious human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial executions. The human rights situation in the region has been the subject of numerous reports by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.\n\nIn 2006 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in the Transnistrian region, which expressed its concern about the human rights situation there and called on the Moldovan and Russian authorities to take urgent measures to improve it.

The cells for pre-trial prisoners were generally larger and better ventilated. However, the cells for prisoners serving sentences were still overcrowded, with some 3 or 4 prisoners sharing a cell measuring only 3.5 m\u00b2.\nThe situation in Prison No 3 was the most satisfactory. The cells were generally larger and better ventilated, and the establishment was not overcrowded.\n43.  The situation in the establishments visited was particularly alarming given that the majority of the prisoners were not convicted and were therefore presumed innocent. It is therefore essential that the authorities take urgent steps to improve the conditions of detention in the penitentiary establishments.\n44.  The authorities have acknowledged the need to improve the conditions of detention and have taken steps to address the problem. In 2001, a new prison was opened in the town of Prizren, which has a capacity of 300 inmates. The establishment has been designed in accordance with modern standards and provides a better living environment for the prisoners. The authorities have also started to renovate the existing establishments.\n45.  The delegation notes that the authorities have also taken steps to reduce the number of prisoners by adopting a more liberal approach to the granting of provisional release. In addition, the authorities have introduced a system of electronic monitoring, which enables persons who have been convicted of minor offences to serve their sentences in their own homes.\n46.  The delegation also notes that the authorities have adopted a new law on the execution of sentences and alternative sanctions, which came into force on 1 January 2002. The law provides for a range of alternative sanctions to imprisonment, such as fines, community service, probation and electronic monitoring.\n47.  The delegation welcomes these developments and encourages the authorities to continue to take steps to improve the conditions of detention and to reduce the number of prisoners.\n48.  The delegation notes that the authorities have also made efforts to improve the living conditions of the prisoners. In the establishments visited, the prisoners were provided with a balanced diet, which included fresh fruit and vegetables. The authorities have also taken steps to improve the medical care provided to the prisoners.\n49.  The delegation notes that the authorities have also taken steps to improve the training and education of the prison staff. The authorities have introduced a training programme for prison officers, which is provided by the Council of Europe. The programme covers a range of subjects, including"}

The Court further notes that the Government ruling was not challenged before the domestic courts.\nThe Court observes that the applicant\u2019s property rights were not protected by the domestic courts. The Supreme Court did not examine the applicant\u2019s complaints in substance and dismissed the case. The regional court upheld the first-instance judgment, which was based on the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the case of A. (see paragraph 16 above).

The Court notes that the Government did not provide any evidence to support their assertion that the applicant had not raised the issue of the attack on \u201cKazakhstan\u201d in the domestic proceedings. Moreover, the Court notes that the Government did not provide any explanation as to why the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings was not relevant to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention.\n81. The Court reiterates that the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings concerning the attack on \u201cKazakhstan\u201d is relevant to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It considers that the Government\u2019s failure to investigate the attack on \u201cKazakhstan\u201d and bring the perpetrators to justice may have contributed to the deterioration of the applicant\u2019s mental health and that the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings in 2003 could have had a further negative impact on his mental state.\n82. The Court notes that the Government did not provide any information as to whether the applicant was aware of the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings concerning the attack on \u201cKazakhstan\u201d.\n83. In the light of the above, the Court considers that the Government\u2019s failure to investigate the attack on \u201cKazakhstan\u201d and bring the perpetrators to justice, and the discontinuation of the criminal proceedings in 2003, contributed to the applicant\u2019s suffering and may have had a negative impact on his mental health.\n84.

In the light of the foregoing, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant\u2019s detention was lawful and does not accept the Government\u2019s argument that the applicant\u2019s detention was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1 (c) of the Convention.\n\n124.  The Court therefore concludes that the applicant\u2019s detention from 11 to 12 January 2003 was in violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n125.  The Court notes that the applicant did not claim any compensation for the violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n126.  In the light of the above, the Court considers that the applicant has suffered non-pecuniary damage as a result of the violation of Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. Making its assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\nB. Costs and expenses\n127.  The applicant claimed EUR 2,000 in respect of the costs and expenses incurred before the Court.\n\n128.  The Government did not comment on this claim.\n\n129.  In accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, costs and expenses follow the event and are recoverable in so far as they have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, the Court does not find it necessary to award the applicant any costs and expenses under this head.\n\nC. Default interest\n130.  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank"}

No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\u201d\n\nThe Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 complaint. It held that the domestic courts had not violated the applicants\u2019 right to a fair hearing, and that the applicants had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the authorities had acted negligently. It also held that the applicants had not been deprived of their possessions except in the public interest, and that the authorities had acted in accordance with the general principles of international law.\n\nThe applicants then brought an application to the European Court of Human Rights, complaining that the domestic courts had violated their rights under Articles 6 and 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nThe Court notes that the applicants\u2019 complaint concerns the State\u2019s duty to provide adequate compensation for damage caused by natural disasters. It reiterates that the State\u2019s duty to protect property is not absolute and that it may be subject to limitations in the interests of the general public. The Court recalls that the State\u2019s duty to protect property is particularly important in cases where the State has created a danger or hazard that is likely to cause damage to property. In such cases, the State must take reasonable measures to protect the property of those who are likely to be affected by the danger or hazard.\n\nThe Court observes that"}

The Government also submitted that the applicant had been able to travel to Kharp to see her mother. The Court notes that the applicant\u2019s mother had died in 2005, when the applicant was 14 years old. The Court considers that the fact that the applicant was able to visit her mother before she died does not in any way diminish the hardship caused by the fact that the applicant had not seen her mother for six years.\n\n347.  In conclusion, the Court finds that the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s health problems and the applicant\u2019s own health problems, which were exacerbated by the absence of her mother, and the fact that the applicant had not seen her mother for six years, amounted to exceptional circumstances which justified the granting of a visa.\n\n348.

However, it considers that in the circumstances of the case, it was not reasonable to expect the applicant to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of her complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.\n\n352.  In particular, the Court notes that the applicant\u2019s mother died in 2005, when the applicant was 14 years old. The Court considers that the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s death, and the applicant\u2019s consequent loss of her mother\u2019s support, was a factor of particular importance in the applicant\u2019s life and that it was reasonable for the applicant to wish to visit her mother as soon as possible.\n\n353.
