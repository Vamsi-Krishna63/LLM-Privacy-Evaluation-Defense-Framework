They argued that the Musayev brothers had been arrested on 23 September 1999 and had been held incommunicado since then.

He also stated that he had not been able to obtain any information about the investigation into the attack.  The Prosecutor's Office of the Chechen Republic responded to Mr Khamzayev's application on 22 November 1999, stating that the investigation into the attack was ongoing and that the first applicant had been questioned as a witness. The Prosecutor's Office also informed Mr Khamzayev that he could obtain further information about the investigation from the investigating authorities.

The Court further held that the fact that the applicant had not been consulted in the process of identifying the alternative land did not render the compensation illusory. The Court found that the Government had acted in good faith and had not abused its powers in identifying the alternative land.\n23.  The Court accordingly held that the taking of Land A did not violate the applicant's right to property under Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention.\n24.  The Court also held that the taking of Land A did not violate the applicant's rights under Article 6 of the Convention, as the proceedings before the Constitutional Court had been fair and impartial.\n25.  The Court further held that the taking of Land A did not violate the applicant's rights under Article 13 of the Convention, as the applicant had not been prevented from exercising its rights under the Convention.\n26.

They claimed that the authorities had been aware of the danger of flooding but had failed to take appropriate measures to prevent it.\n21.  The Government submitted that the flooding had been caused by heavy rainfall and that the authorities had taken all necessary measures to prevent it. They argued that the water level in the Pionerskoye reservoir had been lowered as soon as possible, but that it had not been possible to lower it earlier due to technical reasons.\n22.  The Court notes that the applicants' homes were flooded as a result of the rise in the water level in the Pionerskoye reservoir. The Government have submitted that the flooding was caused by heavy rainfall, but they have not disputed that the water level in the reservoir had not been lowered in a timely manner. The Court considers that the authorities had a duty to take appropriate measures to prevent the flooding, including lowering the water level in the reservoir in a timely manner. The fact that the water level was not lowered until 20 June 2000, despite the fact that the danger of flooding had been identified on 29 May 2000, raises questions as to whether the authorities took all necessary measures to prevent the flooding.\n23.

He found that the applicant had left her house voluntarily in April 1994 and that her husband was still alive. He recommended that the case be closed for lack of evidence.\n46.  The case file was then sent to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Security Court, which was responsible for the prosecution of terrorism-related offences. The court examined the file and decided to close the case, finding that there was no evidence to support the applicant's allegations. The court's decision was based on the findings of the investigator, who had conducted an extensive investigation into the matter.\n47.  The applicant was informed of the decision to close the case and was given the opportunity to appeal against it. She did not avail herself of this opportunity.\n48.  The Court observes that the applicant has not disputed the factual findings of the investigator, nor has she provided any evidence to challenge the conclusions reached by the investigator and the State Security Court.

The Government also pointed out that the investigation had been carried out in a difficult and unstable situation, with the region being subject to a counter-terrorist operation and the investigators facing threats from illegal armed groups.\n42.  The Court notes that the Government's submissions do not provide a clear explanation for the lack of progress in the investigation into Vakhid Musikhanov's disappearance. While the Government referred to the difficulties faced by the investigators, including the lack of cooperation from the applicants, they did not provide any concrete examples of the steps taken to address these difficulties and to ensure the effectiveness of the investigation.\n43.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the investigation into Vakhid Musikhanov's disappearance has not been effective and has not been conducted in a manner that would allow for the establishment of the truth about his fate.\n44.

The Magistrate issued a writ of eviction on 22 July 1993.  The tenant filed an appeal with the Salerno Court of Appeal on 29 July 1993.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 10 August 1993.  The tenant filed a further appeal with the Supreme Court on 26 August 1993.  The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on 13 October 1993.  The tenant was ordered to vacate the apartment by 20 November 1993.  The tenant did not comply with the order and the applicant requested the bailiff to evict the tenant.  The bailiff served a writ of eviction on the tenant on 22 November 1993.  The tenant did not appear before the bailiff and the bailiff was unable to evict the tenant.  The applicant then applied to the Salerno Magistrate for an order to have the tenant forcibly removed.  The Magistrate ordered the tenant to be forcibly removed on 24 November 1993.  The tenant was forcibly removed from the apartment on 25 November 1993.\n8.  The applicant complains that her right to peaceful enjoyment of her property was violated by the tenant's refusal to vacate the apartment and by the lengthy and complex procedure which she had to undergo in order to obtain an order to evict the tenant.

The court also held that the impugned advertisements had not been intended to be offensive or to incite hatred or intolerance against any religious group. It further observed that the applicant company had not sought to promote any particular religious belief or to criticise any religious group, but had merely sought to promote its own products in a manner that was intended to be humorous and attention-grabbing.\n31.  The court found that the domestic authorities had not overstepped their margin of appreciation in considering that the impugned advertisements had not been in conformity with the principles of religious tolerance and respect for religious beliefs. It held that the authorities had been entitled to consider that the advertisements had been likely to cause offence to certain religious groups and had therefore been justified in prohibiting them.\n32.  The court further observed that the applicant company had not been prevented from promoting its products in other ways that did not offend against the principles of religious tolerance and respect for religious beliefs. It held that the prohibition on the impugned advertisements had not therefore constituted a disproportionate interference with the applicant company's freedom of expression.\n33.  The court accordingly dismissed the applicant company's complaint under Article 10 of the Convention.\nIV.  Conclusion\n34.  The court's judgment in the present case is consistent with its previous case-law concerning the protection of religious freedom and the prohibition of hate speech. The court has consistently held that the protection of religious freedom and the prohibition of hate speech are important values that must be balanced against the freedom of expression. In the present case, the court has held that the domestic authorities were entitled to prohibit the impugned advertisements, which had been likely to cause offence to certain religious groups and had not been intended to contribute to any public debate or to promote any particular religious belief. The court's judgment is also consistent with the principles of respect for religious beliefs and tolerance, which are fundamental values in a democratic society.\nV.  Conclusion\n35.

S.\n(1) Under Article 45 of the Code of Administrative Justice, appeals against decisions of the administrative court are heard by the Council of State.\n(2) The European Court of Human Rights has held that the right to respect for home and private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights does not necessarily guarantee the right to occupy a particular dwelling or to resist eviction, see, for example, the case of Chapman v. the United Kingdom, no. 27238/95, 18 January 2001.\n(3) Under Article 13 of the Code of Administrative Justice, the Council of State may, on its own initiative or at the request of a party, refer a question of law to the Court of Cassation.\n(4) Under Article 41 of the Code of Administrative Justice, the decisions of the Council of State are not subject to appeal.\n(5) The case-law of the Court of Cassation is not binding on the Council of State, but it is highly persuasive.\n(6) The Besson Act, which was enacted in 1990, provides for the regularisation of certain occupations of land that are in breach of the provisions of the municipal land-use plan."}

They argued that the applicants had not provided any evidence to support their claims and that the investigation had not established any involvement of the authorities in the disappearance.\n38.  The Court notes that the applicants have submitted a number of documents and statements which, in their view, support their allegations of ill-treatment and torture of Luiza Mutayeva by the authorities. However, the Government have disputed these allegations and submitted that the investigation did not establish any involvement of the authorities in the disappearance.\n39.  The Court considers that the issue of whether Luiza Mutayeva was subjected to ill-treatment and torture by the authorities and whether the authorities were involved in her disappearance is a matter of fact that requires careful examination. In this connection, the Court notes that the investigation into the disappearance was carried out by the authorities themselves, and that the investigation was not transparent and did not involve the applicants.\n40.  The Court also notes that the Government have not provided any explanation as to why Luiza Mutayeva was taken to the police station on 19 January 2004, why she was held there for several hours, and why she was released only after her father had arrived at the station.

The increased travel and trade, as well as the increase in the number of people living in urban areas, contribute to the spread of diseases. 3.  In addition to the increase in travel and trade, the rise in global temperatures is also a factor in the spread of infectious diseases. Mosquitoes and other insects are more likely to survive in warmer climates, which increases the risk of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. 4.  The increased use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has also contributed to the spread of infectious diseases. The overuse of antibiotics has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it more difficult to treat infections. 5.  The lack of access to healthcare and clean water in many parts of the world also contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. In some areas, people do not have access to vaccines, which can help prevent the spread of diseases. 6.  In addition, the lack of awareness of the importance of personal hygiene and proper sanitation can also contribute to the spread of infectious diseases. This includes not washing hands regularly and not properly disposing of human waste. 7.  In some cases, the spread of infectious diseases can also be attributed to the lack of preparedness and response to outbreaks. In some cases, governments and healthcare systems are not prepared to handle outbreaks, which can lead to the spread of diseases. 8.

With the increase in air travel, people are more likely to come into contact with people who are infected with diseases, which can lead to the spread of diseases. 9.

The Court notes that the Government has not provided any evidence to support its claims that the figures provided by Memorial are inflated or that the NGO has no reliable sources of information.  The Court also notes that the Government has not disputed the fact that the federal forces have been involved in military operations in the Chechen Republic, or that these operations have resulted in civilian casualties.

The court further found that the municipality had not violated the applicants\u2019 rights by not registering the disputed land as public property in the official planning charts, since the registration of property in those charts was not a condition for the existence of public property.  The court also considered that the applicants had not shown that they had suffered any damage as a result of the municipality\u2019s actions.

The Supreme Court found that the disputed land had become public property by virtue of its long-term use by the local people, and that the municipality had not violated the applicants\u2019 rights by not registering the land as public property in the official planning charts.  The court also found that the applicants had not shown that they had suffered any damage as a result of the municipality\u2019s actions.

The oil and gas fields were developed and the oil and gas production started in the 1970s. The oil and gas production in the North Sea has been a major contributor to the Norwegian economy and has made Norway one of the world\u2019s leading oil and gas producers.\n10.  In 1972, the Norwegian Government established the State\u2019s share of the petroleum production as a separate fund, the Petroleum Fund (now called the Government Pension Fund Global). The fund was established in order to manage the revenue from the petroleum production in a responsible and sustainable manner, and to ensure that the revenue from the non-renewable resources was used for the benefit of both present and future generations.\n11.  The Petroleum Fund has since its establishment been used to invest in foreign securities, in accordance with a set of ethical guidelines. The investments are made in a responsible manner, taking into account the impact on the environment, human rights and other ethical considerations. The Petroleum Fund is today the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, with assets of more than USD 1 trillion.\n12.  The petroleum production in the North Sea has also had a significant impact on the development of the Norwegian economy and society. The oil and gas production has contributed to the creation of a highly skilled workforce, the development of a strong and competitive supplier industry, and the creation of a solid infrastructure for transportation and communication. The revenue from the petroleum production has also been used to finance a wide range of public services and investments, such as education, health care, transportation, and culture.\n13.  The petroleum production in the North Sea has also had some environmental consequences. The production has resulted in emissions of greenhouse gases, and there have been some incidents of pollution and environmental damage. The Norwegian Government has therefore taken a number of measures to minimize the environmental impact of the petroleum production, such as implementing strict regulations and standards for the industry, and investing in research and development of new technologies and methods for reducing the environmental impact.\n14."}

However, the \u0130mral\u0131 9 remains in service, albeit only for the benefit of the applicants and a few other residents of \u0130mral\u0131.  33.  The applicants maintained that the conditions in which the \u0130mral\u0131 9 operated were unsafe. The boat was old and not suitable for the rough sea conditions that often occurred in the area. They also complained that the Tuzla, which was larger and more modern, was not always available to them. The applicants argued that the Government had failed to fulfil its positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to ensure that they had access to a safe and effective means of transportation to and from \u0130mral\u0131.  34.  The Government argued that the \u0130mral\u0131 9 was seaworthy and had been operating for many years without any major incidents. They acknowledged that the Tuzla was a better boat, but pointed out that it was not available to the applicants alone, but to all residents of \u0130mral\u0131. The Government considered that they had fulfilled their obligation under Article 2 of the Convention by providing a safe and effective means of transportation to and from \u0130mral\u0131.  35.  The Court observes that the applicants were not able to use the Tuzla, which was the larger and more modern ferry boat, for their daily commute to and from \u0130mral\u0131. The \u0130mral\u0131 9, which was available to them, was an old boat that was not suitable for the rough sea conditions that often occurred in the area. The Court finds that the conditions in which the \u0130mral\u0131 9 operated were unsafe and that the applicants were exposed to a real and immediate risk of harm when using it. The Court therefore considers that the Government failed to fulfil their positive obligation under Article 2 of the Convention to ensure that the applicants had access to a safe and effective means of transportation to and from \u0130mral\u0131.  36.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention.  37.

The applicant appealed the decision to the Moscow City Court. He argued that he had not violated any immigration rules and that the decision to expel him was unlawful.  On 22 November 2006 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the decision to expel him.

The Vilnius Regional Administrative Court, in its decision of 10 October 2003, found that the Ministry of Justice had acted in accordance with the law. The Court noted that the Ojas Meditation Centre\u2019s by-laws stated that its purpose was to promote self-improvement and personal growth through meditation and other methods based on the Osho teachings. It also noted that the Osho movement had no status as a religion in Lithuania. The Court therefore found that the Ministry of Justice had not infringed on the Centre\u2019s right to freedom of religion and that there was no discrimination against the Centre on the grounds of its religious beliefs.\n58.  The Ojas Meditation Centre appealed against the decision to the Supreme Administrative Court. The Centre argued that the lower court had not considered the fact that the Osho movement was a worldwide movement with a significant number of followers and that it had been recognised as a religion in several countries.

The investigators also reviewed the IVS\u2019s logbook and found no record of Abdul-Yazit Askhabov\u2019s detention.  The investigators concluded that the applicants\u2019 allegations were unfounded.\n58.

They pointed out that the investigation had been conducted by different investigators, and that the applicants had not been able to provide any evidence to support their allegations.\n59.  The Court finds that the investigation into the applicants\u2019 allegations was not effective.  The investigators relied solely on the statements of the police officers who had been involved in the detention and questioning of Abdul-Yazit Askhabov, and did not interview any other witnesses or collect any other evidence that could have shed light on the circumstances of his death.  The investigators did not even visit the scene of the alleged crime until more than two months after the fact.  Furthermore, the investigation was not conducted by an independent body, but by the same authorities who were accused of being responsible for Abdul-Yazit Askhabov\u2019s death.  The Court is not persuaded by the Government\u2019s argument that the investigation was thorough and impartial.\n60.  The Court notes that the investigation was also marred by the fact that the applicants were not informed of the progress of the investigation, and were not given access to the case file.  They were not even informed of the decision to close the investigation, and only learned of it through a letter from the prosecutor\u2019s office.  The Court finds that this lack of transparency and communication with the applicants undermines the effectiveness of the investigation and violates the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 38 of the Convention.\n61.  In the light of the above, the Court finds that the investigation into the death of Abdul-Yazit Askhabov was not effective and did not provide a sufficient basis for the conclusion that the applicants\u2019 allegations were unfounded"}

The reason for the dispute was a woman who is said to have been seen in the company of the Federal President on several occasions. The lady in question is a certain Dr L., a psychologist who has been working for the President\u2019s office for several years. The rumour is that she has been in a close relationship with Klestil for some time.\nThe Federal President has not yet made any official comment on the matter, but sources close to the Klestils have dismissed the rumours as nonsense. The President\u2019s office has, however, taken the unusual step of issuing a statement on the matter. It reads: \u2018The Federal President\u2019s office hereby declares that the allegations of a relationship between the President and a certain Dr L. are entirely without foundation.\u2019\nBut even the most die-hard Klestil supporters are beginning to wonder whether there might not be a grain of truth in the rumours. After all, what is the point of a statement like that if there is really nothing to it? The President\u2019s office is not exactly known for its candour, and the Klestils have always been a bit of a mysterious couple.\nAnd then there is the fact that the President\u2019s wife, Margot Klestil-L\u00f6ffler, has recently been seen in the company of a certain Mr M., who is said to be a member of the President\u2019s staff.\nThe rumour mill is working overtime, and it seems that the Klestils are about to become the main topic of conversation in Vienna\u2019s salons.

The applicant challenged the accuracy of M.N.\u2019s statement. She argued that her husband had not been afraid that she would harm herself or the children, but that he had been afraid that she would leave him and take the children with her. She submitted that this was evident from the fact that he had taken the children to the police station and had not allowed her to see them for a long time.\n28.  The Court observes that the domestic authorities did not make any findings as to the accuracy of M.N.\u2019s statement. Nor did they question the applicant\u2019s husband about his motives for taking the children to the police station. In these circumstances, the Court is not in a position to establish the truth of the matter. However, it notes that the applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s actions in taking the children to the police station and preventing the applicant from seeing them for a long time are not consistent with his alleged fears for their safety.\n29.  The Court further notes that the domestic authorities failed to take appropriate measures to protect the applicant\u2019s right to respect for her family life. In particular, they did not ensure that the applicant had access to her children, despite her repeated requests to see them.\n30.  The Court recalls that the right to respect for family life is a fundamental right protected by Article 8 of the Convention. It is not limited to the relationship between parents and children, but also encompasses the relationship between adults who have established a family life together (see, for example, the Marckx v. Belgium judgment of 13 June 1983, Series A no. 61).\n31.  The Court also recalls that the State has a positive obligation to protect the right to respect for family life. This obligation requires the State to take appropriate measures to ensure that family life is protected and that the unity of the family is maintained, except in cases where the interests of the children or the health and well"}

The Government also submitted that the investigators had inspected the records of the detention centres in Chechnya and found no information about Bekkhan Alaudinov\u2019s detention. 54.  The Court notes that the Government\u2019s submission is not supported by any documents or evidence. The Government has not produced any copies of the queries sent to the various State bodies, nor any responses received from them. Furthermore, the Government has not provided any information as to the exact dates when these queries were sent and when the responses were received. In the absence of any concrete evidence, the Court cannot accept the Government\u2019s submissions as sufficient to discharge their burden of proof in this respect. 55.  The Court also notes that the Government\u2019s submissions are not consistent with the evidence available in the case file. The witness statements collected by the investigators and the applicants\u2019 submissions suggest that Bekkhan Alaudinov was arrested by State agents on 10 February 2000 and that he has been held in detention since then. In view of this, the Court finds it difficult to accept that the investigators would have sent queries to various State bodies and received negative responses. 56.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s submissions are not convincing and do not provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure of the investigators to find Bekkhan Alaudinov. The Court therefore concludes that the investigators did not take all necessary steps to establish the whereabouts of Bekkhan Alaudinov and that the domestic investigation was inadequate in this respect. 57.

The applicants complained that the domestic law did not provide for adequate compensation for the loss of their property and that the reimbursement of investments was not sufficient to compensate for the loss of their property. 149. The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 are directed against the 1991 Denationalisation Act and the subsequent legislation which regulated the restitution of property in kind. The Court observes that the applicants\u2019 property was expropriated in 1968 and that they were not able to regain their property until 1991, when the Denationalisation Act was passed. The Court further notes that the applicants were not entitled to restitution in kind and that they were offered compensation in the form of reimbursement of investments made in the property. 150. The Court recalls that the protection of property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is not limited to the protection of the owner\u2019s right to use and enjoy his property but also extends to the protection of the owner\u2019s right to have his property restored to him in the event of an unlawful taking (see, among other authorities, the Sporrong and L\u00f8vstr\u00f6m v.

In 2011, the Portuguese Ombudsman issued a report that found that the HSC was not complying with the rights of its patients, including the right to privacy, dignity, and autonomy.\n\nThe lack of adequate security measures in the HSC is also a concern for the patients themselves. In 2013, a patient who had been involuntarily hospitalised in the HSC for two years reported that she had been subjected to physical and psychological abuse by staff members, and that she had attempted to escape several times due to the lack of adequate care and security measures in place.\n\nIn conclusion, the HSC has been criticised for its poor management, lack of adequate security measures, and inadequate living conditions. The cases of patient escapes and violence highlight the need for urgent action to address these issues and ensure the safety and well-being of patients and staff.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Di\u00e1rio de Coimbra.

On 25 June 1998 the Portuguese authorities rejected the applicant's claim and ordered his deportation to the DRC. The decision was based on the following grounds:\n(a)  The applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was a political refugee. In particular, the documents submitted by the applicant did not establish that he had been persecuted for reasons of his political opinions or that he had a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to the DRC.\n(b)  The applicant had not provided a satisfactory explanation for his departure from the DRC and his journey to Portugal.

The Court notes that the applicant has been consistently complaining about the lack of adequate medical care in the prison and the fact that his health has been deteriorating. The Government have not provided any information or evidence to refute these allegations. In fact, the Government's representative confirmed during the hearing that the applicant had been diagnosed with a number of serious medical conditions, including tuberculosis, and that he had been receiving treatment in the prison hospital.\n44.  The Court observes that the applicant's health problems have been ongoing for a significant period of time and that he has been consistently seeking medical attention. It appears that the medical care provided to the applicant in the prison has not been adequate to address his health issues, and that he has been experiencing significant pain and discomfort as a result.\n45.  The Court notes that the applicant has been requesting to be transferred to a civilian hospital for medical treatment, but that this request has been repeatedly denied. The Government have not provided any explanation for this denial, other than referring to the fact that the applicant is a convicted person and that his transfer to a civilian hospital would be subject to the relevant procedures.\n46.  The Court observes that the applicant's situation is not unique and that there have been numerous cases before it in which prisoners in Russia have complained about the lack of adequate medical care in prisons. The Court notes that in many cases it has found violations of Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the lack of adequate medical care and the failure to provide adequate medical treatment to prisoners (see, for example, the case of S.G. v. Russia, no. 1707/06, 22 June 2007).\n47.  In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the applicant's complaints about the lack of adequate medical care in the prison and the fact that his health has been deteriorating are not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 (a) of the Convention. It further finds that the applicant has exhausted all available domestic remedies in respect of his complaints."}

It alleges that the Swiss had been complicit in the Nazi regime\u2019s crimes, that they had collaborated with the Nazis and had even profited from their relationship. It is claimed that the Swiss authorities had helped the Nazis to persecute the Jews and had closed their borders to those seeking refuge from the Holocaust. The programme alleges that the Swiss had allowed the Nazis to use their country as a transit point for the transportation of weapons and goods to the enemy powers. The narrator goes so far as to say that the Swiss had \u2018betrayed\u2019 the Jews, as the title of the programme implies.

He also complained that the handcuffing had caused him physical pain and that he had been subjected to verbal abuse by prison staff. 16.

It will therefore proceed to examine the merits of the complaints. 17.  The Government maintained that the applicant's placement in isolation and handcuffing had been ordered in accordance with the relevant regulations, which provided for such measures to be taken in respect of prisoners who posed a danger to the security of the prison or to the safety of prison staff.

However, the Court observes that, in the present case, the applicant was placed in isolation and handcuffed without any individual assessment of the risk that he posed. The decision to place him in isolation and to handcuff him appears to have been based solely on the fact that he had been charged with a serious offence and not on any consideration of his individual circumstances or of the risk"}

The applicants\u2019 transfer to prison 29/4 was a result of their own request, and it is not clear that they were in danger in that prison. The incident of 19 April 2003 was not a threat which could have been anticipated by the authorities.

The Court finds that the applicants did not do everything they could to prevent the risk of harm to themselves and to alert the authorities to any danger.\n31.  In the light of the above, the Court considers that the applicants have not shown that they were in a situation of a real and immediate risk to their lives or health, and that they did not do everything they could to prevent the risk of harm to themselves and to alert the authorities to any danger.\n32.

It is worth noting that the roadblocks referred to in this case are not mentioned in the Government\u2019s observations on the case.  The Government\u2019s failure to mention these roadblocks may be seen as an attempt to conceal the fact that the men who abducted Aslan Israilov and Bulat Chilayev were members of the security forces.  The Court considers that this is a serious violation of Article 3 of the Convention.  In its judgment in the case of Imakayeva v.

However, they maintained that the shelling had been carried out by the Chechen rebels. In their submission, the Chechen fighters had fired the shells from the nearby village of Goryachevodsk, which was under their control at the time. 14.  The Court notes that there is a significant discrepancy between the parties\u2019 versions of the events. While the applicant claims that the shelling was carried out by the Russian military, the Government maintain that it was the Chechen rebels who were responsible. In such circumstances, it is important to establish the facts of the case through a careful examination of the evidence. 15.  In order to determine the source of the shelling, the Court considers it necessary to have recourse to expert evidence. It is noteworthy that the Government did not provide any expert opinion or technical analysis to support their version of the events. In contrast, the applicant submitted a report by a military expert, who concluded that the shelling had been carried out by the Russian military. 16.  The Court notes that the expert report submitted by the applicant is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence, including the location of the shell craters, the type of ammunition used and the trajectory of the shells. The expert concluded that the shelling had been carried out by the Russian military, firing from the Terskiy mountain range. 17.  The Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s version of the events is supported by the witness statements collected by the investigators. In particular, the statements of the villagers who were eyewitnesses to the shelling and the first responders who arrived at the scene shortly after the attack, all point to the fact that the shelling was carried out by the Russian military. 18.  In the light of the above, the Court finds that the Government\u2019s version of the events is not supported by the evidence. It is noteworthy that the Government did not provide any convincing explanation as to why the Chechen rebels would have shelled a village that was not under their control and which was located in an area that had been controlled by the Russian military for several years. 19.

The Moldovan Government responded by threatening to cut off gas supplies to Transdniestria. The Transdniestrian authorities, in turn, threatened to seize control of the gas distribution network in the region. The Russian Government then increased the price of gas for Transdniestria by 30% as well.\nThe situation was further complicated by the fact that Transdniestria was not a party to the Energy Charter Treaty and was not bound by its provisions. The Transdniestrian authorities were, therefore, not subject to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in disputes relating to energy issues.\nThe European Union, the United States and the OSCE all expressed their support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Moldova and called on the Russian Government to withdraw its troops from Transdniestria. The European Union and the United States also imposed sanctions on certain Russian officials and companies in response to the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.\nIn 2014, the European Union and Moldova signed an Association Agreement, which included provisions on energy cooperation.

The author of the proposal was so sure of himself that he could not even be bothered to provide any evidence of the feasibility of his idea. He simply declared that it was a panacea, and that was that.\nBut let us go back to the real panacea. The word \u201cpanacea\u201d comes from the Greek words \u201cpan\u201d meaning \u201call\u201d and \u201ckakos\u201d meaning \u201cevil\u201d. In ancient Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of healing, and her name was used to describe a remedy that could cure all ills. The concept of a panacea has been around for a long time, and it has been applied to many different things, from herbs and potions to medical treatments and technological innovations.\nIn modern times, the term \u201cpanacea\u201d is often used metaphorically to describe a solution that can solve a wide range of problems. It can refer to anything from a new technology that promises to revolutionize an industry to a political ideology that claims to have the answer to all society\u2019s ills.\nHowever, the idea of a panacea can also be misleading. It suggests that there is a single solution that can fix everything, and that all we need to do is find it and apply it. This ignores the complexity of the problems we face and the fact that different problems often require different solutions.\nMoreover, the concept of a panacea can be used to justify all kinds of nonsense. For example, a politician might claim that a particular policy or program is a panacea for all the country\u2019s problems, when in fact it is nothing more than a quick fix or a way to win votes.\nTherefore, it is important to be critical of claims that a particular solution is a panacea. We need to look carefully at the evidence and consider the potential consequences of a proposed solution before accepting it as a panacea.

The Azerbaijan SSR refused to grant this request, leading to a violent conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the NKAO and the surrounding areas.\n\n18.  The conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which lasted from 1991 to 1994.
