Many people found it hard to believe that he had not been driving while drunk, given the severity of the accident and the fact that he had turned himself in only after it was no longer possible to detect if he had been driving while drunk. The applicant's denial of any wrongdoing only added to the public's outrage, with many calling for him to be held accountable for his actions.\n\nIn the days that followed, the applicant's reputation was further tarnished by the publication of additional details about the accident. It emerged that the applicant had been driving at a speed of over 100 km/h at the time of the accident, and that he had not been wearing a seatbelt. The public was outraged by these revelations, and many called for the applicant to be stripped of his license and to face criminal charges.\n\nThe applicant's response to the public outcry was to issue a statement denying any wrongdoing and claiming that he had been the victim of a smear campaign. However, his attempts to defend himself only served to further enrage the public, and he was widely criticized for his lack of remorse and his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the applicant's response to the interview and the subsequent public reaction highlighted the deep-seated problems with the country's road traffic safety policy and the need for greater accountability and transparency in the government's handling of such incidents. The incident also underscored the importance of public trust in the government and the need for leaders to be held accountable for their actions."}

The experts also pointed out that the employer had failed to provide the deceased children with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and had not carried out any training on the safe use of such equipment.\n10. In the light of the foregoing, the Court finds that the employer bears responsibility for the accident in question. The absence of wooden panels around the construction site, the absence of railing around the hole, the absence of signs prohibiting entry into the construction site or warning against the water-filled hole on the site, and the lack of diligence of the deceased children are all factors that could have contributed to the accident. However, the employer bears responsibility for these factors, as it failed to ensure that the construction site was properly secured and that the necessary safety measures were in place to prevent accidents. The Court therefore concludes that the employer\u2019s failure to take the necessary measures to prevent the accident was the direct cause of the accident.\n11. The Court also notes that the employer\u2019s failure to provide the deceased children with the necessary PPE and to train them on its safe use is a further indication of the employer\u2019s lack of diligence in ensuring the safety of its employees.

However, we have no reason to believe that these amendments have been aimed at providing a more comprehensive protection for the rights of the child, including the right to education, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nIn this context, we are of the opinion that the legislator has not fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safeguards for the protection of the rights of the child, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and has not provided a legal basis for the segregation of children of Roma origin into remedial schools. We consider that the legislator has not fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safeguards for the protection of the rights of the child, as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and has not provided a legal basis for the segregation of children of Roma origin into remedial schools.\nAccordingly, we consider that the applicants have suffered damage as a result of the unlawful conduct of the respondents, and that the respondents are liable for that damage.\u201d\nIn the light of the above, it is clear that the Court of Appeal found that the lack of appropriate diagnostic tools and the subsequent placement of the applicants into remedial schools was unlawful, and that the respondents were liable for the damage caused to the applicants.\nIn conclusion, the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment is a significant step towards the protection of the rights of the child, including the right to education, and towards the elimination of segregation of children of Roma origin into remedial schools.

The Supreme Court referred to the Higher Court\u2019s judgment, pointing out that the latter court\u2019s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue. That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form, as relied on by the applicant, but also the subsequent amendment, which showed the true aim of the provision. In addition, the Supreme Court relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question, emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence. Since under the un-amended 2008 Criminal Code a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than 1 year and not longer than 10 years, the Supreme Court held that the legislature\u2019s aim in enacting the provision at issue was to ensure that the combined sentence would not be shorter than 10 years.\n\nThe Supreme Court also held that the provision at issue did not violate the protection of legality, since the legislature had not exceeded the limits of its competence in enacting the provision. The Court pointed out that the legislature had the competence to determine the length of the combined sentence, as well as the method of combining multiple sentences. The Court also held that the provision at issue was not in conflict with the Constitution, as the applicant had argued.\n\nIn conclusion, the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's arguments and held that the provision at issue was not in violation of the protection of legality.

The court found that the applicant had not shown any evidence of the lawfulness of his detention, and that the prison authorities had not been able to provide any evidence to support their claim that the applicant should have been detained until 10 July 2009. The court therefore dismissed the ground of appeal.\n\nThe court's decision in this case is not surprising, given that the applicant failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he should have been released on 10 July 2009. The court found that the applicant had not shown any evidence of the lawfulness of his detention, and that the prison authorities had not been able to provide any evidence to support their claim that the applicant should have been detained until 10 July 2009. The court's decision is consistent with the principles of the Convention, which requires that a person must be detained only in accordance with the law and that their detention must be reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the court's decision does raise some questions about the interpretation of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The court's decision suggests that a person who is detained in accordance with the law but who is not released on the date specified in the law may not be entitled to judicial review of their detention. This could have significant consequences for individuals who are detained in circumstances where they are not released on the date specified in the law, but who are detained in accordance with the law.\n\nThe court's decision also raises questions about the role of the European Court of Human Rights in interpreting and applying the Convention. The court's decision suggests that the European Court of Human Rights may be reluctant to intervene in cases where a person is detained in accordance with the law but who is not released on the date specified in the law. This could limit the scope of the Convention and undermine the protection of the rights of individuals under the Convention.\n\nIn conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of the principle of proportionality in the application of Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention. The court's decision also raises important questions about the interpretation and application of the Convention, and the role of the European Court of Human Rights in protecting the rights of individuals under the Convention."}

The clients had the option to transfer their savings to Croatian banks, but some chose not to do so. When they tried to obtain their savings from the bank's assets located in Croatia, they pursued civil proceedings, which were dismissed by the Croatian Supreme Court.

{"idx": 3414, "label": "some twenty-two years ago", "output": "20 years ago, and that the Stasi\u2019s methods of surveillance were not just used to spy on political dissidents, but also to control the everyday lives of ordinary people.\nThe film\u2019s title, \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019, refers to the fact that the Stasi monitored people\u2019s private lives, their conversations, their reading habits, their social contacts, and their political opinions. The agents used all sorts of methods to get information about people, including planting bugs in their homes, using hidden cameras, and even blackmailing people.\nThe agents were not just looking for political dissidents, but also for people who were suspected of being involved in any kind of criminal activity. The film shows how the Stasi used its power to control people\u2019s lives, to manipulate them, to keep them in line, and to prevent them from expressing their opinions or engaging in any kind of political activity.\nThe film\u2019s protagonist is a Stasi agent, Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is tasked with monitoring the lives of a famous playwright and his actress wife. The agent becomes increasingly involved in the lives of the couple and eventually starts to question the morality of his work.\nThe film raises important questions about the balance between individual freedom and state control, and about the role of the police in society. It also highlights the dangers of a police state, where the authorities have the power to monitor and control people\u2019s private lives without their consent.\nIn my opinion, the film is a powerful indictment of the Stasi\u2019s methods and a warning about the dangers of a police state. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting individual freedoms and the need for a balance between state control and individual autonomy.\nThe film was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and was released in 2006. It was a critical and commercial success, and it won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nIn conclusion, \u2018The Lives of Others\u2019 is a thought-provoking and timely film that raises important questions about the role of the police in society. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic of police state and the dangers of a society where the authorities have too much power over people\u2019s private lives.\nThe Lives of O"}

This obligation was not derived from any specific provision of the Charter, but from the general principles of international law applicable to all members of the UN. 33.  Secondly, it is clear from the language of UNSCRs 1511 and 1546 that the Council intended to authorise the use of force by the Multinational Force, not to require it to use force. The Resolutions speak of \u201cauthorising\u201d the Multinational Force to use all necessary means to achieve the objectives set out in the Resolutions, but they do not use language which implies an obligation to use force. 34.  Thirdly, it is important to note that the Council did not limit its authorisation to the period when the UK was an Occupying Power. The Resolutions authorise the use of force for a specific period of time, until the end of the transitional period, but they do not specify the duration of that period. It is not clear why the Council would have wanted to limit its authorisation to a specific period of time if it had intended to impose an obligation on the UK to use force during that period. 35.  I conclude that the Council did not intend to impose an obligation on the UK to use force in Iraq. The authorisation given by UNSCRs 1511 and 1546 was intended to permit the use of force by the Multinational Force, not to require it to use force. The UK\u2019s decision to use force was a matter for its own decision, based on its assessment of the circumstances in Iraq at the time. 36.  I therefore dismiss the appellant\u2019s appeal."}

He noted that the Home Secretary had made it clear that the scheme was not intended to be a substitute for criminal proceedings, but rather a means of dealing with individuals who were not yet in custody.\nOn the third point, Lord Bingham accepted that the legislation was drafted broadly, but he observed that the derogation was not intended to be a blanket exclusion from the operation of the legislation, but rather a limited exception. He noted that the Home Secretary had made it clear that the derogation was not intended to be used as a substitute for the criminal law, but rather a means of dealing with individuals who were not yet in custody.\nIn the end, Lord Bingham concluded that the derogation was not incompatible with Article 5(1) of the ECHR, since it was a proportionate response to the identified threat of terrorism and did not amount to a disproportionate interference with the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned. He also observed that the derogation was not in conflict with the UK\u2019s obligations under the ECHR, since it was a derogation under Article 15(1) of the Convention, which allowed the UK to derogate from certain provisions of the Convention in time of war or other public emergency.\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in this case was not unexpected, given the broad scope of the derogation and the fact that it was a proportionate response to the identified threat of terrorism. However, the decision highlights the importance of ensuring that any derogation from the ECHR is narrowly drafted and limited to the specific circumstances in which it is intended to operate. It also emphasises the need for careful consideration of the potential impact of any derogation on the fundamental rights of individuals, and the importance of ensuring that any derogation is in line with the UK\u2019s obligations under the ECHR."}

The Ministry has requested that the court stay the enforcement proceedings pending the outcome of the appeal, but the court has refused to do so.

It also establishes a code of ethics for all anti-doping professionals.\n\nIn 2007, the WADA established the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) to monitor athletes' biological data over time. The ABP is a database of athletes' blood profiles, which are used to detect the presence of banned substances in their bodies. The ABP is a powerful tool for detecting doping and has been used in numerous high-profile cases.\n\nThe WADA also operates a number of other programmes, including the Anti-Doping Education and Research Programme (ADEP) and the Anti-Doping in Sport (ADIS) programme. The ADEP aims to educate athletes, coaches, and other anti-doping stakeholders about the risks of doping and how to prevent it. The ADIS programme is designed to promote and support the implementation of anti-doping policies and programmes in international sport.\n\nIn addition to these programmes, the WADA has also launched a number of initiatives aimed at improving the effectiveness of anti-doping efforts. These include the development of new testing methods, such as the use of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to detect the use of synthetic drugs, and the establishment of a global anti-doping hotline for athletes and other stakeholders to report suspected doping violations.\n\nOverall, the WADA has made significant progress in its efforts to combat doping in sport. Its work has helped to reduce the number of doping cases and to improve the effectiveness of anti-doping programmes around the world. However, despite these achievements, the fight against doping in sport remains an ongoing challenge, and the WADA continues to work towards a future where doping is eliminated from sport."}

However, I can provide some indirect evidence that may suggest that Yakup's death was a result of torture.\n\nFirstly, the fact that Yakup had a small pustule on his penis, which he had received medical treatment for, suggests that he may have been subjected to sexual torture. This is supported by the fact that sexual torture is a common practice used by the authorities in Turkey to extract confessions from detainees.\n\nSecondly, the fact that Yakup died within a week of his arrest, which is unusually short for a death from natural causes, suggests that he may have been killed as a result of torture. This is supported by the fact that many detainees in Turkish prisons have died as a result of torture, and that the authorities have never been held accountable for these deaths.\n\nFinally, the fact that Major \u015eeker did not conduct any investigation into Yakup's death, despite being informed that Yakup had died as a result of torture, suggests that the authorities were trying to cover up the truth about Yakup's death. This is supported by the fact that the authorities have a history of covering up torture and other human rights abuses in Turkey.\n\nIn conclusion, while I cannot provide any direct evidence to support my claim that Yakup's death was a result of torture, I believe that the indirect evidence I have provided suggests that it is highly likely that Yakup's death was a result of torture."}

They demanded that the government should immediately pass a law to protect tenants from eviction and provide them with adequate social housing.\n\nIn response to this pressure, the government announced that it would introduce a new bill to protect tenants from eviction and provide them with affordable housing. The bill was passed in December 2000, and it became law on 1 January 2001.\n\nThe new law provided for the establishment of a special fund to finance the construction of affordable housing for low-income tenants. The fund was to be financed through a combination of government subsidies and private investment. The law also established a new agency to oversee the implementation of the law and to provide support to tenants in need.\n\nDespite these measures, the tenants' organisations continued to protest against the government's policies, arguing that they did not go far enough to protect tenants' rights. They demanded that the government should immediately implement the law and provide adequate social housing to all those who needed it.\n\nIn conclusion, the Leghorn Magistrate's decision to postpone the enforcement proceedings was a significant turning point in the history of the tenants' movement in Italy. It marked a shift in the government's policy towards tenants, and it paved the way for the passage of a new law that would protect tenants from eviction and provide them with affordable housing. However, the tenants' organisations continued to pressure the government to do more to protect tenants' rights, and the struggle for adequate social housing continued."}

However, the Court maintained that the new evidence that had come to light since the original decision was sufficient to overturn the original verdict.\n\nOn the day of the rehearing, the Court heard arguments from both sides before issuing a decision. The new evidence included a previously undisclosed document that had been written by one of the key witnesses in the case. The document revealed that the witness had lied under oath during the original trial, and that the prosecution had known about the lie but had failed to disclose it to the defense.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to reopen the proceedings was seen as a major blow to the government, which had previously maintained that the original verdict was final and could not be challenged.

One of these strategies is the use of generic drugs, which are cheaper and more affordable than branded drugs. The NHS has been working to increase the availability of generic drugs, particularly for first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs, which are the most commonly prescribed drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment.\nThe use of generic drugs has several advantages, including cost savings, improved access to treatment, and improved patient adherence. Generic drugs are copies of branded drugs that have the same active ingredients, dosage form, and route of administration as the branded drug. They are manufactured by generic drug manufacturers who are licensed by the regulatory authorities to produce and sell these drugs. The cost of generic drugs is significantly lower than that of branded drugs because generic drug manufacturers do not have the cost of developing and marketing a new drug.\nThe NHS has been working to increase the availability of generic drugs through a number of strategies. One of these strategies is the use of generic drug donations, which are provided by international organizations and other donors. These donations have helped to increase the availability of generic drugs in Uganda, particularly for first-line ART drugs.\nAnother strategy is the establishment of generic drug manufacturing facilities in Uganda. The NHS has been working with the private sector and other stakeholders to establish generic drug manufacturing facilities in Uganda. These facilities will produce generic drugs for both local and international markets, and will help to increase the availability of generic drugs in Uganda.\nThe NHS has also been working to improve the quality of generic drugs in Uganda. This involves the establishment of quality control measures and the use of quality assurance programs to ensure that generic drugs meet international standards.\nIn conclusion, the use of generic drugs is a key strategy for improving access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment in Uganda. The NHS has been working to increase the availability of generic drugs,"}

The Code provides that the conditions of election are determined by the law (Article 13 \u00a7 1), and that the law must ensure the equal rights of all citizens (Article 14). The new paragraph does not provide any legal basis for denying the right to stand for election to a deputy in parliamentary elections to persons who hold multiple citizenship. 33.  The restrictions of the new paragraph are also in conflict with the provisions of the Electoral Code concerning the right to stand for election. The Code provides that any person who is a citizen of Moldova, has reached the age of 18, and has the right to vote, has the right to stand for election to the parliament (Article 13 \u00a7 1). The new paragraph does not provide any legal basis for denying the right to stand for election to persons who hold multiple citizenship. 34.  The restrictions of the new paragraph are also in conflict with the provisions of the Constitution, which provide that the right to stand for election is guaranteed by the Constitution (Article 37). The Constitution does not provide any legal basis for denying the right to stand for election to persons who hold multiple citizenship. 35.

For example, while the transcript notes that both parties were present at the hearing and that the judge delivered the decision orally, the text of the decision does not mention the applicant\u2019s lawyer. This is particularly odd, given that the lawyer was present at the hearing and participated in the proceedings. Similarly, while the transcript notes that the decision was delivered orally, the text of the decision does not provide any details about the delivery of the decision.\n\nThe inconsistencies in the text of the decision and the transcript of the hearing are significant because they raise questions about the integrity of the decision-making process. If the decision was indeed backdated, as the applicant alleges, then it is possible that the court did not actually consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing. This could have resulted in a flawed decision that is not in line with the law.\n\nTo resolve the inconsistencies in the text of the decision and the transcript of the hearing, the court could have taken several steps. Firstly, the court could have conducted a thorough review of the evidence presented at the hearing and the transcript of the hearing to determine whether there were any discrepancies or inconsistencies. Secondly, the court could have questioned the parties about the inconsistencies and sought clarification on the matter. Finally, the court could have taken steps to correct the inconsistencies in the text of the decision, such as issuing a corrected decision or providing an explanation of why the inconsistencies exist. By taking these steps, the court could have ensured that the decision was fair and impartial, and that the integrity of the decision-making process was maintained."}
