The Tartars were among the first to take advantage of this policy and began to assert their national identity and cultural heritage.\n\nIn 1989, the first Tartar national congress was held in Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan. The congress was attended by representatives from across the Tartar-inhabited regions of the Soviet Union and adopted a declaration of sovereignty for the Tartar people. The congress also established the Supreme Soviet of the Tartar Republic, which became the highest legislative body in Tatarstan.\n\nIn 1990, the Soviet government recognized the sovereignty of Tatarstan and granted it the status of a \u201csovereign republic\u201d within the USSR.

On 15 February 2004 the Jura cantonal authority rejected her application on the ground that she did not meet the conditions for adoption laid down in the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (hereinafter: the Convention) and in Swiss law. The authority based its decision on the fact that the appellant did not have a family home, that her professional activities were not stable and that she did not have sufficient financial resources. The appellant brought an action against the decision before the Swiss administrative court, which dismissed her appeal. She then brought the present action before the European Court of Human Rights. 3.3.  The Court notes that the appellant seeks to adopt a child from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Convention is intended to ensure that intercountry adoptions are made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights. To this end, it lays down certain requirements that the prospective adoptive parents must meet. These requirements include, in particular, that the applicants must have a family home and a stable and regular income. The Convention also provides that the authorities of the State of origin must be consulted in the adoption process and that the child\u2019s consent must be obtained if he or she is over a certain age. The Court further notes that the Swiss legislation transposes the Convention into national law and that the Swiss authorities are bound to apply these provisions when examining applications for adoption. 3.4.

However, this intention cannot justify the defamatory nature of the allegations made in the book.\nThe court concluded that the author had defamed Jean-Marie Le Pen and his party by associating them with racist crimes and propaganda, and ordered the author to pay damages of 100,000 francs to Jean-Marie Le Pen and 50,000 francs to the Front National.

He further alleged that the first-instance court had not taken into account the fact that he had been in prison for more than two years and that his detention had been extended several times. He alleged that this had been done without any evidence of his guilt and that his detention had therefore been arbitrary. 27. On 17 October 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint about the lack of access to the case file, the court found that the applicant had had sufficient time to consult the case file on 1 October 2004 and that he had not requested additional time. The court further found that the applicant had been given copies of some of the documents he had requested and that he had not shown that he had not had access to all the documents he needed for his defence. As regards the alleged violation of the right to a fair trial, the court found that the applicant had not substantiated his allegations and that the first-instance judgment had been based on sufficient evidence.

The appellant refers to the provisions of the Polish Constitution, which guarantee the freedom to form associations and to preserve one's own culture, as well as to the right to self-determination.\nThe appellant also argues that the concept of 'nationality' is not defined in Polish law, and that the lower court's approach is based on an incorrect interpretation of the term. The appellant refers to the fact that the Constitution does not define the term 'nationality', but only provides that everyone has the right to belong to the nation of their choice.\nThe appellant argues that the creation of a 'Silesian national minority' would not violate the principle of unity of the Polish state, as it would not involve the secession of any part of Polish territory or the creation of a separate state.

The Court notes that the applicant is represented by a lawyer before the Court.  However, it is the Court\u2019s practice to apply the principle of subsidiarity, according to which it is generally preferable for the Court to have the assistance of a lawyer or other legal expert in the proceedings before it (see, among many other authorities, the Kula and Others v.

The Court notes that the applicant complained that the authorities had not carried out an effective investigation into the circumstances of his son\u2019s death.

The court finally noted that, in light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, it was for the national authorities to strike a fair balance between the conflicting interests at stake, and that the court\u2019s role was limited to reviewing whether the legislation in question was proportionate and compatible with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. 83.  The court concluded that the legislation in question was proportionate and compatible with the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and that the applicant\u2019s rights had not been violated. 84.

This is a particularly serious matter because [judge \u0160.] is a former judge of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, and his words have the potential to mislead the public and to distort the historical truth.\nIt is essential to recall that the Nuremberg Trials, held in 1945-1946, were a milestone in the history of international law and the prosecution of war crimes. The trials were held in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, which was adopted by the Allied powers on 8 August 1945. The Charter defined crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and established the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over individuals who had committed such crimes.

This is a baseless and unfounded claim which has been repeatedly refuted by historians. The retribution decrees were adopted by President Bene\u0161 in 1945 in accordance with the principles of international law and the rules of the United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimes.

In the context of the implementation of the law on the return of the village guard system, it is important to note that the village guard system was a traditional system of local self-defence that had been in place in the region prior to the conflict.

It is responsible for granting exploration and production licences, supervising the compliance with the regulatory framework, and collecting and disseminating data on the petroleum industry. 11.

In particular, the investigators had failed to question the witnesses who had been present at the scene of the events and had not examined the site of the alleged bombing.\n175.

They submitted that the investigation had been conducted in good faith and that the investigators had taken into account all the available evidence, including the statements of the witnesses and the results of the forensic examination.\n176.  The Court reiterates that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention requires the authorities to conduct a thorough and effective investigation into any death where there is a suspicion that the life of the deceased was taken by, or with the acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (see, among other authorities, Kaya v.

The Government submitted that the report reflected the results of an official examination of the register of military actions of the aircraft of the United Group Alignment, and that it was therefore a reliable source of information. They noted that the report had been prepared by the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation, and that it had been based on the records of the military units involved in the operations in Chechnya.\n152.  The Court notes that the report reflects the results of an official examination of the register of military actions of the aircraft of the United Group Alignment for the period from 29 September 1999 to 20 January 2000.

For example, Mr A. stated that the convoy was escorting two foreign-made cars, while Mr Sh. and Mr V. stated that the convoy was escorting one car. Mr A. and Mr V. stated that Mr Dzh. had purchased the cars, while Mr Sh. stated that he did not know who had purchased the cars.

The Court reiterates that the obligation to protect the right to life under Article 2 of the Convention requires the authorities to carry out a thorough and effective investigation into any death occurring under their responsibility or in their jurisdiction (see, among many other authorities, Kaya v. Turkey, no. 23301/94, \u00a7 105, ECHR 2000-III).\n\nIn the present case, the Court notes that the applicants alleged that their relatives had been killed as a result of the use of excessive force by the authorities and that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding their deaths. The Court observes that the investigation has been pending for more than five years and that the applicants have complained about the inadequacy of the investigation.\n\nThe Court notes that the investigation has not been concluded and that the applicants have not been provided with any information about the progress of the investigation. The Court also notes that the applicants have submitted evidence which they claim supports their allegations, but which has not been properly examined by the authorities.\n\nIn view of the above, the Court considers that the applicants have made out a prima facie case that the authorities failed to conduct an effective investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of their relatives. The Court therefore finds that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of each of the applicants.\n\nThe Court further notes that the applicants also complained under Article 13 of the Convention about the lack of an effective remedy in"}

The Court reiterates that Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person. The right to receive visits from family members and friends is an essential aspect of the right to respect for private and family life guaranteed by Article 8 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, Kud\u0142a v.

However, this information has not been corroborated by any other evidence. The Government have submitted that Baysayev was not listed among the detainees or among those detained by other detachments of the Ministry of the Interior in 2000.

The applicants argued that the interception of the Winner and the search of the ship constituted an unlawful interference with their privacy, as they were not suspected of any criminal activity and had no connection with the drugs found on board the ship.\n13.  The Colombian courts rejected the applicants\u2019 arguments and found that their rights under Article 7 of the American Convention on Human Rights had not been violated. The Colombian courts held that the interception of the Winner and the search of the ship were justified on the basis of the OCRTIS\u2019s suspicions that the ship was carrying drugs, and that the applicants had been lawfully arrested and their rights had been respected during the search of the ship.\n14.  The applicants then brought the present case before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, arguing that their rights under Article 7 of the American Convention on Human Rights had been violated. The Commission found that the applicants\u2019 rights under Article 7 of the American Convention on Human Rights had been violated and that Colombia was responsible for the violation.

Its population was composed of Romanians, Hungarians, Germans, Jews and other ethnic groups.\n\nThe Romanians in Transylvania, who were the majority, were initially under the rule of the Hungarian kings, but they enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. They had their own institutions, such as the Diet of Transylvania, which was the legislative body of the Principality, and the Romanian Orthodox Church, which was the predominant religious denomination.\n\nThe Romanians in Moldavia and Wallachia were also under the rule of the Hungarian kings, but they were subjected to a more direct and oppressive rule. They were denied the right to have their own institutions and were subjected to discrimination in matters of religion and language.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Romanians in Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia began to assert their national identity and to seek greater autonomy and independence. They were inspired by the Renaissance movement and by the ideas of the Reformation, which encouraged them to challenge the status quo and to seek greater political and religious freedom.\n\nThe Romanian national movement was led by a number of prominent figures, such as the Transylvanian prince Gabriel Bethlen, the Moldavian prince Dimitrie Cantemir and the Wallachian prince Constantin Brancoveanu. These leaders sought to unite the Romanians in the three principalities and to create a common political and cultural identity.\n\nThe Romanian national movement also received support from other countries, such as Russia, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. These countries saw the Romanians as a potential ally in their struggle for power and influence in the region, and they provided support and protection to the Romanians in their quest for independence.\n\nThe Romanian national movement reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the Romanians in the three principalities began"}

In particular, the rain caused a landslide in the area of the 26th of August, which resulted in the death of two people and the destruction of a number of buildings. The landslide was caused by the intense rainfall that fell in a short period of time, which resulted in the saturation of the soil and the collapse of the slope.\n\nThe plaintiff, who was a resident of the area, brought an action against the State for damages resulting from the landslide. The plaintiff alleged that the State was liable for the damage caused by the landslide as a result of the inadequate maintenance of the slope.\n\nThe State argued that it was not liable for the damage caused by the landslide as it was an unforeseeable event and that the damage was caused by an exceptional meteorological event, which was beyond the control of the State.\n\nThe Court found that the State was liable for the damage caused by the landslide. The Court held that the State had failed to take adequate measures to maintain the slope and that the landslide was a direct consequence of the State\u2019s failure to fulfil its obligations. The Court also held that the exceptional meteorological event was not the sole cause of the damage, as the intensity of the rain was not unforeseeable and that the State could have taken measures to prevent the damage caused by the landslide.\n\nThe Court ordered the State to pay damages to the plaintiff for the damage caused by the landslide. The amount of damages was determined by the Court based on the evidence presented during the trial.\n\nOverall, this case demonstrates the importance of the State\u2019s obligation to take adequate measures to maintain public areas and prevent damage caused by natural disasters.

The applicant argues that the search of his home and the seizure of his property were not necessary in the circumstances and were therefore unreasonable and disproportionate. He also argues that the search and seizure were carried out without a warrant and that the investigators did not have any reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence.\n40.  The Court reiterates that, in accordance with the Convention, searches and seizures of property must be \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d, that is, they must be provided for by national legislation and subject to the safeguards prescribed by law. Furthermore, any interference with the right to respect for private life must be proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved.\n41.  In the present case, the Court notes that the search of the applicant\u2019s home and the seizure of his property were carried out as part of a criminal investigation. However, it is not clear from the documents submitted to the Court whether the search and seizure were carried out in accordance with national legislation and the relevant safeguards.\n42.

It noted, however, that the use of heavy artillery in built-up areas was generally prohibited under customary international law, except in cases where it was necessary to respond to an immediate threat and there was no alternative means of doing so. The Court also noted that the use of such weapons was subject to the general principles of necessity and proportionality, and that the military authorities were required to take all feasible precautions to minimise the risk of harm to civilians.\n21. The Court further noted that the Government had not disputed that the shelling of 82 had caused civilian casualties, and that it had acknowledged that the incident had been investigated by the military authorities.

The programme then goes on to describe how this collective memory has been shattered by recent research, which has revealed that Switzerland was not as innocent as it had been portrayed. The programme claims that Switzerland was not just a passive observer of the events of the Second World War, but an active participant in them. It asserts that Switzerland was not just a neutral country, but a country which traded with the Nazis, accepting their gold and thus helping to finance the war. The programme claims that Swiss banks helped the Nazis to launder their loot, and that Swiss companies profited from the use of forced labour. The programme argues that Switzerland\u2019s supposed neutrality was a myth, and that it was in fact a cynical and self-serving policy which allowed Switzerland to pursue its own interests at the expense of others. 8.  The programme then goes on to describe the reaction of the Swiss authorities to these revelations. It claims that the Swiss government has known for years about the involvement of Swiss companies in the use of forced labour, but has done nothing about it. It asserts that the Swiss authorities have been more concerned with protecting the reputation of Swiss industry than with acknowledging and atoning for its past mistakes. The programme argues that the Swiss authorities have been guilty of a cover-up, and that they have tried to suppress the publication of research which reveals the truth about Switzerland\u2019s involvement in the Second World War. 9.

The relevant regulations in force at the time provided, inter alia, that a prisoner could be placed in an isolated group if he had been charged with an offence carrying a sentence of life imprisonment or if there were serious reasons to believe that he had committed a particularly serious offence (Article 11 of the Prisons Regulations). A prisoner in such a group was to be subjected to stringent security measures, including the deprivation of certain rights (Article 12). The decision to place a prisoner in an isolated group was to be taken by the prison governor (Article 13).\n17.  The applicant complained that the decision to place him in an isolated group and to deprive him of the right to take part in communal activities, as well as the subsequent decision to handcuff him whenever he was separated from the group, amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. He also complained that the decision to place him in an isolated group was disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued and therefore violated his right to respect for his private life under Article 8 of the Convention.\n18.  The Court notes that the applicant was charged with a serious offence and that the authorities had reasonable grounds to believe that he might pose a risk to prison staff. However, the Court considers that the measures taken against the applicant were severe and went beyond what was necessary in the circumstances. The fact that the applicant was handcuffed each time he was separated from the isolated group, even when he was in the exercise yard, appears to be an unnecessary and disproportionate restriction of his freedom of movement. Furthermore, the applicant's right to take part in communal activities was completely curtailed, which constituted a further violation of his right to respect for his private life under Article 8 of the Convention.\n19.

According to the FSB, the militants were planning to carry out a series of terrorist attacks in the region, including the assassination of the head of the administration of the Shatoysky district, the chairman of the district court and the chief of the local police.\n\nSalman Raduyev was one of the most prominent field commanders of the Chechen separatist movement. He was involved in the capture of Grozny in 1994 and in the hostage-taking at a hospital in Budyonnovsk in 1995. He was also implicated in the killing of Russian parliamentarians in 1996. Raduyev was granted amnesty in 1997 and became a member of the Chechen parliament. However, he subsequently left the republic and became involved in armed opposition to the Russian authorities.\n\nThe operation in which Raduyev was killed was carried out in the early hours of May 19. According to the FSB, the militants opened fire on the security forces, who then returned fire, killing Raduyev and several other militants. The operation was carried out without casualties among the security forces.\u201d\n\nThe second newspaper cutting is from the same newspaper and is dated 23 May 2001.

The applicant also stated that she had seen the servicemen in the village on the day of the killings.\n59.  The Court notes that the domestic investigation into the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths has not been conclusive. It also observes that the involvement of the special forces in the events of 21 May 2003 in Kalinovskaya has not been confirmed by the investigation. However, the Court also notes that the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the involvement of the UGA servicemen in the killings have not been definitively refuted by the domestic authorities.\n60.  In view of the conflicting evidence and the lack of a conclusive domestic investigation, the Court finds that the allegations of the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths at the hands of servicemen of the UGA remain unresolved. It notes that the applicant\u2019s account of the events is consistent with the unidentified men in camouflage and masks armed with automatic weapons, who were seen in the village on the day of the killings.\n61.  The Court therefore finds that there has been a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in respect of the applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 deaths.\n62.  The applicant also complained under Article 2 of the Convention about the alleged disappearance of her husband, Aslan Malkov, on 20 May 2003.\n63.

According to the Government, the investigation had established that Aslan Malkov had been released from the checkpoint on the same day and had returned home.\n64.

The section does not specify whether the disqualification applies only to those serving a sentence of imprisonment or detention in a mental institution.\n\n19.  In the UK, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has considered the issue of the right to vote for prisoners in several cases. In the case of Hirst v United Kingdom (No 2) (2005) 42 EHRR 41, the ECtHR held that the UK\u2019s blanket ban on prisoners voting was incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR.

The State assumes a responsibility when it grants a licence or permit, and the licence holders are aware of this. The State\u2019s liability for damage caused by the activity is therefore not excluded by the rules on state liability."}

Ilinden brought an action before the Bulgarian courts challenging the refusal to register it as a political party.  In its action, Ilinden argued, inter alia, that the prohibition on the use of the term \u201cMacedonian\u201d in the name of a political party was contrary to Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), which guarantees the right to freedom of assembly and association.\n\n12.

Ilinden then brought the present application to the European Court of Human Rights, alleging that Bulgaria had violated its right to freedom of assembly and association, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Convention, by refusing to register it as a political party on account of the use of the term \u201cMacedonian\u201d in its name.\n\n14.  The European Court of Human Rights found that there had been a violation of Article 11 of the Convention, as the prohibition on the use of the term \u201cMacedonian\u201d in the name of a political party was not necessary in a democratic society and was disproportionate to the aim of protecting national unity and preventing ethnic tensions.\n\n15.

The ROG\u2019s actions were supported by the Russian government, which on 27 June declared that it would not recognize any territorial changes in the region. The situation was aggravated by the fact that the ROG\u2019s troops were not under the control of the Moldovan authorities and that the Russian government refused to cooperate with the Moldovan authorities in the framework of the Joint Control Commission, established by the 1990 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Moldova and Russia.\n\nThe conflict resulted in the displacement of a significant number of people, mostly Moldovans, who fled the fighting and the humanitarian situation in the region was dire. The international community, particularly the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the European Union, tried to mediate the conflict and to find a peaceful solution, but their efforts were hampered by the lack of cooperation from the Russian government.\n\nThe conflict ended in 1992 with the signing of the \u201cAgreement on the principles for the settlement of the Transdniestrian problem\u201d between Moldova and Russia, which provided for a ceasefire, the establishment of a Joint Control Commission and the holding of a referendum in Transdniestria on its status.

The country\u2019s geographical position, its political stability, its modern infrastructure and its attractive climate have all contributed to its popularity as a destination for tourists, including those who engage in sex tourism. The presence of numerous foreign women, particularly from Eastern Europe, who work in the tourist industry, has also created a demand for sexual services, which has been met by trafficking in women.\n30. The problem of trafficking in women is not new to Cyprus. It has been reported since the early 1990s, but it is only in recent years that it has become a matter of public concern. The police have been carrying out operations to combat the problem, but the number of women being trafficked into the country has continued to increase.\n31. The majority of women who are trafficked into Cyprus come from Eastern Europe, particularly from Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova. They are recruited through deception, often by promises of well-paid jobs, and are brought to Cyprus by traffickers who have established networks in their home countries. On arrival, they are often forced into prostitution and are kept in conditions of virtual slavery. They are subjected to physical and sexual violence, and are not allowed to leave their place of work or to communicate with the outside world.\n32. The trafficking of women for sexual exploitation is a serious violation of human rights. It involves the use of force, fraud or coercion to exploit women for commercial sexual purposes. It is a form of modern-day slavery and is a serious crime under both Cypriot and international law. It is also a major challenge to the rule of law and to the protection of human rights in Cyprus.\u201d\n92.

They had recently completed a new prison in the region and were planning to build more. However, the delegation\u2019s observations suggested that these measures were not sufficient to cope with the current situation, let alone to reduce the number of prisoners.\n44.  The delegation considers that the overcrowding in the region\u2019s penitentiary establishments is a serious obstacle to the protection of prisoners\u2019 human rights. It is also a matter of concern that the authorities have not yet been able to implement effective measures to alleviate the situation. The delegation recommends that the Committee urge the authorities to take all necessary steps to reduce the number of prisoners and to ensure that the conditions of detention comply with international standards.\n45.  The delegation also wishes to draw the Committee\u2019s attention to the problem of the use of pre-trial detention. In the region, the use of pre-trial detention is widespread and, in some cases, appears to be excessive. The delegation recommends that the Committee encourage the authorities to review their policies on the use of pre-trial detention and to ensure that it is only used in exceptional circumstances and for the shortest possible period.\n46.  The delegation further recommends that the Committee urge the authorities to ensure that prisoners have access to adequate medical care, including mental health care, and that their health needs are assessed on a regular basis.

On 21 July 1998 the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) to the European Commission issued Opinion no. 11 \u201cOn Ethical aspects of human tissue banking\u201d. Its relevant parts read:\n\u201c2.3 Information and consent\nThe procurement of human tissues requires, as a principle, the prior, informed and free consent of the person concerned. This does not apply in the case of tissue procurement ordered by a judge in the context of judicial, in particular criminal, proceedings.\nWhile consent is a fundamental ethical principle in human tissue banking, it may be limited or waived in certain circumstances. For example, in cases where the tissue is to be used for research, the need to protect the donor\u2019s identity may override the requirement for consent. However, such limitations must be justified in the light of ethical principles and must be subject to appropriate safeguards.\n2.4 Research on human tissues\nResearch on human tissues raises a number of ethical issues. The use of human tissues for research purposes must be subject to strict ethical controls. Researchers must ensure that the tissues are obtained and used in accordance with ethical principles and that the dignity and rights of the donor are respected.\nIn particular, researchers must ensure that the tissues are obtained from individuals who have given informed consent for their use in research. The consent process must be transparent and comprehensive, and the donor must be provided with all relevant information about the research project.\nResearchers must also ensure that the tissues are used in a manner that is consistent with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. In particular, they must ensure that the tissues are not used in ways that would be harmful to the donor or that would violate their dignity.\n2.5 Commercial use of human tissues\nThe commercial use of human tissues raises a number of ethical issues. The tissues must be obtained and used in accordance with ethical principles, and the dignity and rights of the donor must be respected.\nIn particular, the commercial use of human tissues must be subject to strict ethical controls. The tissues must be obtained from individuals who have given informed consent for their use in commercial activities. The consent process must be transparent"}

In these circumstances, the fact that he is a UK national is of little assistance to the appellants\u2019 argument.\n36.  The final step in the appellants\u2019 argument is that, even if the Secretary of State has power to detain suspected international terrorists indefinitely, that power is subject to constitutional limitations. The appellants rely on the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. They submit that the power to detain without charge or trial is incompatible with the right to liberty and security of the person under Article 5 of the Convention. They also submit that the power to detain indefinitely is incompatible with the right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention. They rely on the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A v United Kingdom (2002) 35 EHRR 243, in which the Court held that the United Kingdom\u2019s system of control orders, under which suspected international terrorists were subject to a range of restrictive measures, was incompatible with Article 5 and Article 6 of the Convention.

The NKAO was established by the Soviet government in 1923, following the Sovietization of the Caucasus. The establishment of the NKAO was the result of an agreement between the Soviet government and the leaders of the local Armenian population, who sought autonomy in order to protect their cultural and political rights. The NKAO was granted a high degree of autonomy, including its own legislative, executive, and judicial bodies, as well as its own flag and anthem.\n2.  The population of the NKAO was predominantly Armenian, with Armenians constituting some 75% of the population. The Azerbaijani population, which was concentrated in the regional capital, Stepanakert, was estimated to be around 20%. The remaining 5% of the population was composed of Russians, Kurds, and other ethnic groups.\n3.  The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict began in the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union was in the process of disintegration. The conflict was sparked by demands from the local Armenian population for unification with the Armenian SSR. This led to clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces, with the Armenians eventually gaining control over the NKAO and neighbouring territories.\n4.  The conflict has since escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the latter receiving military support from Turkey. The war has resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of populations, with thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.\n5.  The international community has attempted to mediate the conflict through various peace talks and ceasefire agreements, but so far, a lasting solution has not been found. The conflict remains unresolved, with occasional flare-ups of violence.\n6.  The conflict has significant geopolitical implications, as it has strained relations between Russia and Turkey, and has also impacted regional energy security.\n7.
