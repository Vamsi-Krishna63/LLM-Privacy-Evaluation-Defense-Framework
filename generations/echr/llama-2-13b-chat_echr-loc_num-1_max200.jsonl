The Tartars are followers of Islam, and their religion has been a major factor in their history and culture.\n11.  The Tartars have a long history of statehood. In the 13th century, the Golden Horde, a Tartar khanate, united the Tartar tribes and became a powerful state that controlled much of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In the 16th century, the Tartars established the Khanate of Crimea, which lasted until the 18th century.\n12.  The Tartars have been subject to various forms of discrimination and oppression throughout their history. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire subjected the Tartars to forced assimilation and persecution, and the Soviet Union carried out a policy of \u201cTatarization\u201d that sought to suppress the Tartars\u2019 cultural and religious identity.\n13.  In the 1990s, the Tartars began to reassert their identity and seek greater autonomy within the Russian Federation. In 1992, the Supreme Council of Tatarstan declared the republic\u2019s sovereignty, and in 2002, a new constitution was adopted that recognized the Tartars as a indigenous people.\n14.  Today, the Tartars continue to face challenges in their efforts to preserve their culture and identity.

Despite these challenges, the Tartars have made significant progress in recent years in preserving their culture and identity.

The Moldovan Government further argued that the Russian Federation had failed to fulfill its obligations under the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances of 1994, in particular, to respect the independence and territorial integrity of Moldova and the sovereignty of its authorities.\n24.  The Russian Government denied any responsibility for the situation in Transdniestria and maintained that the conflict was an internal matter of Moldova, which should be resolved by the parties concerned through negotiations. They argued that the Russian troops stationed in Transdniestria were there at the request of the Transdniestrian authorities and were intended to ensure the security of the Russian-speaking population in the region. They further argued that the presence of their troops in Transdniestria was justified by the need to prevent the conflict from escalating into a wider war and to maintain stability in the region.\n25.  The Court notes that the conflict in Transdniestria is a complex and long-standing one, which has caused significant human suffering and economic hardship. The parties to the conflict have had differing perspectives on the origins and nature of the conflict, and the Court has had to consider a wide range of evidence and arguments in order to determine the responsibility of the Russian Federation under the Convention.\n26.  The Court recalls that, under Article 1 of the Convention, the High Contracting Parties are required to secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention.

The author, who is not a journalist, is not subject to the same rules of professional ethics as a journalist, but the book is a text that is publicly distributed, and it is therefore necessary to consider the consequences of its publication.\nIt is a question of determining whether the author, in writing this book, has infringed the rights of the Front National, and, in particular, whether he has violated the right to respect for his reputation, the right to the protection of his private life, and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and expression.\nThe Front National is a political party that, in the eyes of the public, has been associated with racist and xenophobic ideas. It is a party that has been the object of numerous criticisms and attacks, and which has been the subject of several legal proceedings.

This is the main reason for the continued discussion of the tables and the search for new methods and equipment to reduce the risk of DCS.\n\n[2]  The tables are based on the assumption that the diver will breathe air with a fixed O2 content, and that the diver will follow the ascent profile indicated in the table. However, divers are not always able to follow the profile exactly. In addition, the tables do not take into account the diver's physical condition, which is a major factor in the risk of DCS. The tables also do not take into account the diver's experience, which may be a major factor in the diver's ability to avoid DCS.\n\n[3]  The use of increased O2 content in the breathing gas in order to reduce the ascent time is a major factor in the risk of DCS. The increased O2 content increases the risk of convulsions and lung damage, and the risk of DCS is increased by the increased ascent rate.\n\n[4]  In order to reduce the risk of DCS, it is important to have a good understanding of the physiological and medical factors that affect the risk of DCS. The risk of DCS is increased by the use of increased O2 content in the breathing gas, and the increased ascent rate. The risk of DCS is also increased by the diver's physical condition, and the diver's experience.\n\n[5]  The use of a compression chamber is one method that can be used to reduce the risk of DCS. The compression chamber allows the diver to make a slow and controlled ascent, and the diver can be monitored for signs of DCS. The compression chamber also allows the diver to be treated for DCS, if it occurs.\n\n[6]  In conclusion, the use of diving"}

The 14th Army was the only army in the Soviet Union to be based on the territory of a non-Soviet state. In 1990, the Soviet government had begun to withdraw the 14th Army from Moldova, but in 1991 the withdrawal was halted.\n\nThe Soviet Union\u2019s withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova was a major factor in the country\u2019s declaration of independence on 27 August 1991. The presence of the 14th Army had been a source of tension between Moldova and the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union was in the midst of political and economic turmoil. The Soviet government was faced with the threat of collapse, and the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova was seen as a symbol of the Soviet Union\u2019s weakness. The withdrawal of the 14th Army also weakened the Soviet Union\u2019s grip on Moldova, and paved the way for the country\u2019s declaration of independence.\n\nThe withdrawal of the 14th Army was not without controversy. Some in Moldova saw the Soviet Union\u2019s decision to withdraw the army as a betrayal, while others saw it as a necessary step towards independence. The withdrawal of the 14th Army was also seen as a threat to regional stability, as it left a power vacuum in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova was a significant event in the country\u2019s history, and a major factor in its declaration of independence. The withdrawal of the army weakened the Soviet Union\u2019s grip on Moldova, and paved the way for the country\u2019s independence.

He requested that the case be investigated and that the officials who had committed the offences be held accountable.\n57.  On 27 November 2003 the prosecutor-general's office informed the first applicant that it had received his complaint and that it would be examined. However, it did not take any further action.\n58.

The decision was not challenged by the applicants, who instead raised a number of other complaints under Article 3 of the Convention, which were not relevant to the present case.\n84.  The applicants did not dispute the factual background of the incident, but argued that the decision to use force had been taken in breach of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to protect the right to life of the civilian residents of the area.\n85.  The Court notes that the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 2 of the Convention is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It further notes that the decision to use force in the circumstances of the present case was a complex one, requiring careful balancing of the competing interests at stake.\n86.  The Court has consistently held that the use of force by State authorities must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and must not violate the essence of the right to life (see, among other authorities, the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of K. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, \u00a7 107).\n87.  In the present case, the Court notes that the decision to use force was taken in the context of an armed conflict and that the relevant military authorities had taken measures to minimise casualties among civilian residents of the area. The Court further notes that the applicants have not demonstrated that the use of force was not proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued or that it violated the essence of the right to life.\n88.  In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that the decision to use force in the circumstances of the present case was not in breach of the State\u2019s positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention.\n89.  The Court therefore dismisses the applicants\u2019 complaint under Article 2 of the Convention.\n90.  The Court further notes that the applicants have not raised any other complaints under the Convention that are relevant to the present case.\n91.  In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that there is no further need to examine the complaints under Article 3 of the Convention or Article 13 of the Convention.\n92.  The Court accordingly"}

The Court noted that the applicant had been acquitted of all charges, but that the case had still had a chilling effect on his freedom of expression and that of others.\n59.  The Court held that the charges brought against the applicant had been based on the content of his newsletter and the opinions expressed therein, and that the charges had been brought with the intention of restricting the applicant\u2019s freedom of expression.\n60.  The Court found that the charges had not been brought in accordance with the requirements of Article 10 of the Convention, and that the applicant had not had a fair and impartial trial.\n61.

In the light of the above, the Court finds that the applicants have not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution and that the Government's offer of a safe place to live was a reasonable and appropriate response to their situation.

In 2012, the parents separated and the mother, who had sole custody of A., moved to Qatar with the child. The father remained in Italy. In 2013, the mother, who had remarried, applied for Italian citizenship for A., which was granted. In 2014, the father, who had been living in Italy, filed an application with the court for the return of A. to Italy under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the \"Hague Convention\"). The mother opposed the application, arguing that A. was settled in Qatar and that his return would cause him psychological harm. The Bologna Youth Court held a hearing on the matter, which was attended by the father and the mother, as well as by social services. The court noted that the mother had taken A. away from Italy without the father's consent, and that the child had been in Qatar for more than a year. The court also noted that the father had consented to A.'s transfer to Italy and had eventually moved to Qatar. It further observed that the child had been in Italy for more than a year and was integrated into Italian society, albeit with some problems. In this light, the court considered that psychological harm would ensue as a result of his return. Thus it was not obliged, according to Article 13 of the Hague Convention, to order his return. Indeed, from the social services report ordered by the court, it appeared that A. had arrived at the NPI's \n\nThe Bologna Youth Court thus found that the mother had not arbitrarily taken A. away from his father as the legitimate custodian of the child, and that, in view of the relevant international law, it could not be held that the mother had taken A. away from his father without his consent. The court noted that the Romanian authorities had not yet taken a decision on custody, thus the parents had joint custody, and therefore the applicant did not have exclusive custody rights. Moreover, the applicant had consented to A.'s transfer to Italy and had eventually moved to Qatar. Furthermore, the Bologna Youth Court observed that the child had"}

The authorities have tended to focus on the criminal aspects of the problem, rather than on the broader social and economic issues which underlie it.\n30. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197) is a valuable instrument for combating trafficking in human beings. Cyprus has not yet ratified the Convention, but it has made a commitment to do so in the near future. The authorities should be encouraged to ratify the Convention as soon as possible, and to use it as a basis for combating trafficking in human beings.\n31. The Cypriot authorities should also take a broader approach to combating trafficking in human beings, one that takes into account the social and economic factors which underlie it. This could include measures to improve the economic and social situation of women in Cyprus, as well as measures to raise awareness of the problem and to promote the rights of victims.\n32.

In particular, it suggests that the authorities should consider the introduction of alternative measures to imprisonment, such as community service or electronic monitoring, for non-violent offenders, and that they should take steps to increase the number of prison staff and to improve the working conditions of those staff.\nThe delegation also recommends that the authorities take steps to improve the physical conditions of the penitentiary establishments, including the provision of more living space and better sanitary facilities, and that they should ensure that prisoners have access to adequate medical care and other essential services.\nThe delegation further recommends that the authorities should ensure that the rights of prisoners are respected and protected, including their right to humane treatment and to access to the courts.\nThe delegation looks forward to receiving the authorities\u2019 comments on these recommendations and to hearing their plans for addressing the situation."}

The Court notes that the discovery of several corpses in the Urus-Martan district in May 2002 and the lack of information about the circumstances of these discoveries raise serious concerns about the applicant\u2019s case.

This would mean that all individuals under the age of 18 would be subject to immigration control and would be required to obtain entry clearance or a Certificate of Approval in order to marry in the UK.\n\n(d) The potential consequences of not including 16 and 17 year olds in the definition of \u201cpersons subject to immigration control\u201d are that they may be more vulnerable to forced marriages and may not have the same level of protection as adults. Additionally, it may be more difficult to identify and prevent forced marriages among this age group if they are not subject to immigration control."}
